==============================

Using the follow command to make. (It's already make-ed)

make


There are some arguments you can pass to the Parser

-d enable dynamic scoping (It's static scoping by default)

-p preload car, cdr, cons and combinators

-ne no environment output (recommend to enable when testing number / list combinators, otherwise too many things come out)


We have a file named Preload, in which you can define more functions to preload.
By default, it includes all combinators. Enable them by -p.

We have several test cases. Use them by

cat Input_sample | java Parser

cat Input_multi_lambda | java Parser

cat Input_multi_let | java Parser

cat Input_scope | java Parser

cat Input_scope | java Parser -d    # dynamic scoping

cat Input_list | java Parser -p    # enable preload

cat Input_comb_test | java Parser -p -ne    # enable preload, disable environment output

etc. All test cases match Input_*

or you can simply

echo "(+ 1 2)" | java Parser
