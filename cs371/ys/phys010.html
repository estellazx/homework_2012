Preface</CENTER></H2>

<P><TT>This is a Web version of a handbook (published by NOAA)
designed to fill a gap that exists between what is available to
researchers in the way of detection, and what is available to the
public in the way of protection from microbursts -- small-scale,
severe storm downdrafts that are a major threat to aircraft during
takeoff or landing. The best microburst detectors, such as Doppler
radars and lidars, have been indispensable in field projects but
until recently were not operational at most major airports. Although
Terminal Doppler Weather Radars (TDWR) have been deployed in the
United States beginning in the early 1990s, these sensors are
unlikely to be available internationally and at smaller airports.
This gap in air safety can be filled by predictions that can alert,
hours in advance, all those concerned with the threat of a potential
microburst occurrence, together with visual identifications that can
alert tower and flight crews that a microburst is actually
happening.</TT></P>

ABSTRACT</CENTER></H3>

<P>Aid is provided for spotters who are visually identifying
microbursts and for forecasters who identify the environments in
which microbursts are likely to happen. Following a discussion of
physical models of a microburst environment, on which forecasts are
based, two environmental extremes (wet/dry) for microbursts are
described and typified by corresponding soundings, and illustrated
through photographs that portray the type of sky associated with
these environments. A vortex ring model of the flow within a
microburst is shown, to aid in identification through its integration
of subtle visual clues, which are liberally illustrated in the color
photographs. The model accounts for the following characteristics
that warn of microbursts: (1) precipitation (or dust) curl that is
carried by the wind back up toward cloud base; (2) horizontal bulging
near the surface in a precipitation shaft, forming a foot-shaped
prominence; (3) an increase rather than a decrease in wind speed as
the microburst expands out over the ground; and (4) abrupt surface
wind gusts followed by a rapid dissipation of some types of
microbursts.</P>

<H3>1. INTRODUCTION</H3>

<P>Strong, concentrated downdrafts from convective showers and
thunderstorms (downbursts; Fujita 1985) have caused a number of
commercial passenger jets to crash on attempted takeoffs and landings
(see also Fujita and Byers 1977; Fujita and Caracena 1977). The
hazard occurs principally when the spatial scale of the downburst is
on the order of a runway length. Because of the importance of this
scale, Fujita (1985) defined a microburst as a downburst that extends
no more than 4 km (2.2 n mi) over the surface. The smaller spatial
scale of a microburst converts into tighter wind shear gradients that
are experienced in the penetrating aircraft as more rapid changes in
wind vector, perhaps well in of the inertial capabilities of the
airplane. That the microburst is just the right scale and intensity
to crash an aircraft is evidence by the number of accidents
associated with microbursts over about a decade
(<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_01.JPG">Fig.
1</A>). Microbursts also pose hazards to small sailboats that are
capsized by sudden-shifting, strong winds, and to those fighting
forest fires, who may be suddenly engulfed in a fire storm fanned up
in an unexpected direction by a microburst.</P>

<P>This handbook explores the detailed, small-scale structure of
microbursts, as well as the upper-air conditions that form the
setting for microburst-producing storms. The discussion of the
environmental setting for microbursts should be of special value to
those faced with the task of forecasting them. Smith (1986) suggested
that microbursts be classified as observable phenomena. The
photographic section will help pilots, controllers, and weather
observers in visual identification of microbursts. Such visual
identifications will help fill gaps in forecasting and remote sensing
of microbursts and furnish the National Weather Service with a means
of obtaining observational data on microbursts to complement those
from other sources such as the WSR-88D and TDWR Doppler radars.</P>

<H3>2. DEFINITIONS AND OTHER PRELIMINARIES</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>a. The gust front</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>At one time, it was widely believed that the gust front
(<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_02.JPG">Fig.
2</A>), or leading edge of rain-cooled air, was the main wind-shear
threat presented by thunderstorms to aircraft in takeoff or landing.
The gust front is formed along the leading edges of large domes of
rain-cooled air that result from the amalgamation of cold downdrafts
from individual thunderstorm cells, and may be large enough to be
analyzed on the National Weather Service (NWS) surface charts as
meso-scale (or bubble) high pressure areas (Fujita 1963). High
surface pressure here results from the denser, cool air that piles up
over the surface in a dome. At the edge of this dome, the horizontal
surface pressure gradient pushes the cool air outward into the warmer
air as a density current (Charba 1974: Hall et al. 1976). At the
leading edge of this current, the gust front, there is the dynamic
clash between the cool outflowing air and the warmer thunderstorm
inflow that produces the characteristic windshift, temperature drop,
and gusty wind that precede a thunderstorm.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>b. Downburst and microburst</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Studies of two wind-shear-related crashes that happened in 1975
have shown that the accidents were caused by the aircraft's
encountering concentrated thunderstorm downdrafts rather than gust
fronts. In his weather analysis of the Eastern Flight 66 crash at
J.F. Kennedy International Airport of June 1975, Fujita (1976) showed
a strong concentrated along the landing approach very near the crash
site (see also Fujita and Byers 1977). An analysis of surface winds
at Stapleton International Airport of the crash of Continental Flight
469 in August 1975 shows a concentrated, strong outflow that strongly
suggests the impact of a small-scale jet-like downdraft (Caracena
1976; Fujita and Caracena 1977).</P>

<P>Earlier, a court investigating a wind-shear-related accident at
Kano, Nigeria, that happened 24 June 1956 during a thunderstorm (see
Stewart 1958), concluded that "the accident was the result of a loss
of height and air speed caused by the aircraft encountering, at
approximately 75 m (250 ft) after takeoff, an unpredictable
thunderstorm cell which gave rise to a sudden reversal of wind
direction." This ruling, perhaps because of its tentative wording,
does not seem to have alerted the rest of the aviation world to the
dangers of thunderstorm downdrafts to aircraft landing.</P>

<P>Prompted by the Eastern Flight 66 weather analysis and small-scale
starburst wind damage patterns (Fig. 3a) that he observed, Fujita
(1976) coined the term "downburst" to refer to a concentrated severe
downdraft that induces an outward burst of damaging winds at the
surface, to distinguish this feature from a normal downdraft, in much
the same vein as defining a severe tropical storm as a hurricane (see
Fujita, 1985). Because accident data showed that wind-shear accidents
have tended to occur as a result of low-level aircraft encounters
with small-scale downbursts about runway size, Fujita defined the
"microburst" as a downburst of maximum horizontal extent of 4 km (2.2
km).</P>

<P>In this handbook, we use the term downburst when no size scale is
specified, or when speaking of a severe downdraft of horizontal
dimensions exceeding 4 km (2.2 n mi). In some situations a downburst
may begin as a microburst but subsequently spread out and continue to
be strong enough to be classified as a larger scale downburst;
however, it is when the downdraft-outflow structure is compact, as in
a microburst, that it poses a serious hazard to aircraft.</P>

<P>Identification of downbursts on Doppler radar is of general
interest and is important to air safety wherever such radars are
available at airports. An example of a Doppler radar signature for
microbursts is presented in
<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_3b.JPG">Fig.
3b.</A> Note that the Doppler shift pattern is dipolar, similar to a
mesocyclone signature, but oriented such that the axis of the dipole
is aligned roughly parallel to the beam instead of orthogonal to it.
This orientation is due to the strong divergence in the near-surface
wind at the base of a microburst. Divergence causes the strong
gradient in the radial component of the wind that is responsible for
the dipole Doppler shift in alignment with the beam. Doppler radar
detection of microbursts is an important topic in itself; here we
concentrate on visual and other physical aspects of microbursts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>3. PHYSICAL MODELS OF MICROBURSTS</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>a. Flow against a flat plate</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Perhaps the simplest model of a microburst is that of the steady
flow against a flat plate with or without friction and without
buoyancy (Batchelor 1970). Although there are no hydrostatic pressure
changes in this model, there is an impact pressure field that causes
the downflow component to decelerate as air approaches the surface
and the horizontal component of the wind to accelerate outward from
the impact center. For flow fields on the scale of downdrafts from
cumulonimbi (1 km, or 0.5 n I) and downflow components of about 20 m
s<SUP>-1</SUP> (3900 ft per in), this model predicts sharp-impact,
high-pressure areas about 1 km (0.5 n mi) in diameter and about 2 mb
(0.06 in mercury) in amplitude.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>b. Pressure nose</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The Thunderstorm Project report (Byers and Braham 1949) relates
that pressure areas smaller than thunderstorm mesohighs (pressure
noses) were observed. They were less than 8 km (4.3 n mi) in diameter
(the network spacing of meteorological instruments) and lasted only a
few minutes. These pressure noses were observed to occur at
approximately the commencement of the mature phase of a thunderstorm
cell, that is, when rain first began to reach the ground.</P>

<P>Since the Thunderstorm Project, closer spaced and faster
responding instruments have revealed tighter and stronger pressure
noses. Within a microburst, a pressure nose of 2.4 mb (0.07 in
mercury), lasting only 3 minutes, was observed in the Florida Area
Cumulus Experiment (FACE), 1 July 1975 (Caracena and Maier, 1987). In
another microburst, at Dulles International Airport, 26 June 1978, a
5-mb (0.15 in mercury) pressure nose occurred (Bedard, 1984). A
pressure nose of about 4 mb (0.12 in mercury) and with horizontal
extent less than 2 km (1.1 n mi), was analyzed by Fujita (1985). It
occurred in a microburst that passed over Andrews AFB accompanied by
winds in excess of 62 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> (120 kt), minutes after Air
Force One had landed on 1 August 1983. Although tree damage marked
the path of this microburst, peak winds were less than 5 m
s<SUP>-1</SUP> (10 kt) only 4 km (2.2 n. mi) to the left of the
microburst track.</P>

<P>The strong pressure nose that is associated with microbursts
suggests that they behave something like what is expected from the
model of flow against a flat plate, but with negative buoyancy adding
an undetermined hydrostatic component of pressure. However, this
model fails to account for the maximum wind gusts associated with
some observed microburst pressure noses. For example, the wind speed
of the FACE microburst was estimated as 30 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> (58 kt),
but the pressure nose of 2.4 mb (0.07 in mercury) suggests a maximum
wind speed of only 20 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> (39 kt) (through Bernoulli's
equation, following the air streamline along the ground from the
stagnation point of impact to ambient pressure). Although this
discrepancy can be explained by assuming that the stagnation point of
the FACE microburst did not come near the pressure sensor (an
accelerated microbarograph), it is more difficult to explain peak
gusts in excess of 60 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> (117 kt) from a pressure nose
of only 4 mb (0.12 in mercury) in the Andrews AFB microburst.</P>

<P>There is, however, more to the pressure picture than just impact
pressure in that pressure drops as well as rises are observed in
microbursts. In the Andrews AFB microburst for example, Fujita (1985)
analyzed a low-pressure ring surrounding a high-pressure nose. Bedard
et al. (1987) also observed a pressure drop within an impacting
downdraft. This low-pressure ring is not a feature of the model of a
flow against a flat plate, and therefore suggests that a better model
is needed to explain all the known dynamical features of the
microburst.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>c. Vortex-ring circulation in a microburst</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A known dynamical feature that can cause a ring of low pressure on
the edge of a downdraft is some kind of circulation in the form of a
vortex ring surrounding the downdraft core. Caracena (1982) suggested
that airflow in a microburst may be structured as a vortex ring
(<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_04.JPG">Fig.
4</A>) having a downward circulation at the center that reinforces
the downdraft, and a return updraft around the periphery. A vortex
instability appearing as the roll-up of the sides of a sharp-edged,
neutrally buoyant jet impinging on a flat surface was observed by
Didden and Ho (1985) in the laboratory. They noted that this
instability increased the horizontal speed at the outer edge of the
surface boundary layer by 1.6 times the initial velocity of the jet
as the vortex passed over. A vortex roll-up of a microburst with
precipitation curl
(<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_05.JPG">Fig.
5</A>) has been observed in numerical simulations of convective
downdrafts as well (Droegemeier, personal communication 1987; see
also Babcock and Droegemeier 1989), and photographs of microbursts
are suggestive of vortex rings in the curling plumes of dust (Fig. 6)
(see Fujita 1983) or precipitation spray.</P>

<P>The vortex ring model of a microburst's circulation is
corroborated by a number of pressure and photographic observations
taken during field experiments. A small microburst passing through
the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory tower showed a drop in pressure
with the main downdraft (Bedard et al. 1987). Fujita (1983) observed
that a microburst passing over Portable Automated Mesonet (PAM)
station No. 3 during JAWS on 19 May 1982 produced a ring of low
pressure surrounding its high-pressure core. Photographic evidence is
furnished by Fujita's (1985) photograph of a microburst rendered
visible as a ring of dust (see Fig. 15). Further, Waranauskas (see
also Fujita 1985) showed the detailed vertical structure of such a
ring that strongly suggests a vortex circulation.</P>

<P>The dynamics of an expanding ring in the deformation field at the
base of a strong downdraft in the vortex ring model may explain why a
microburst is observed to strengthen as it expands after surface
impact (Wilson et al., 1984) at a time when it should be weakening
because of frictional dissipation. The size and dynamics of a
microburst may be dependent upon the scale and type of precipitation
in a maturing cell. The genesis of a microburst from a downdraft may
proceed as follows (see Fig. 4 and
<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_07.JPG">Fig.
7</A>):</P>

<OL>
   <LI>A concentrated rain shaft or virga shaft, on a scale of about
   1 km (0.5 n mi), forms a concentrated downdraft with a very sharp
   edge,
   
   <LI>across which the horizontal gradient in buoyancy force
   generates strong torques resulting in a sheath of toroidal
   vorticity surrounding the downdraft.
   
   <LI>The impact with the surface, and interaction with the surface
   friction layer, cause this sheath of vorticity to gather up into a
   ring vortex that
   
   <LI>spins up as it is forced to expand diameter by the outflow
   about the base of the downdraft.
</OL>

<P>In fact, there is evidence that not only one, but several vortex
rings may organize at the base of a severe downdraft (Fig. 7), giving
embedded elements of smaller scale, extreme wind shear and turbulence
within the already dangerous, larger scale flow structure of a
microburst. This may have been the situation in two accident cases,
Eastern Flight 66 and Pan American Flight 769 (see Caracena et al.
1983; Fujita 1983) in which periodic, discrete microbursts were
observed several minutes apart.</P>

<P>The presence of multiple vortex rings was suggested in wind
analyses (Caracena et al. 1986; Fujita 1986) based on data from the
flight recorder of a commercial passenger airliner that crashed as a
result of encountering a microburst on final approach (see Fig. 7).
The aircraft successfully traversed the downdraft [at about 200 m
(650 ft) above the surface] only to crash as it encountered several
strong vortices in the low-level outflow.</P>

<P>The periodicity of vortex ring instability explains the wide
variety of microburst life times and characteristics. Most
microbursts are rather short-lived (~5 min), but others have been
observed to last four or even six times as long (Wilson et al. 1984).
Vortex ring instability is a parasitic feature of a downdraft that
acts as a dissipative mechanism. In situations where the flux of air
in a downdraft is not large, one vortex ring may be enough to
dissipate the downdraft energy; the result would be an impulsive,
short-lived microburst. For downdrafts with higher fluxes, several
vortex rings may be initiated, resulting in a series of discrete
microbursts of short duration and spaced several minutes apart. That
happened in the Eastern Flight 66 crash (Fujita and Byers 1977);
three microbursts occurred along the landing approach within a period
of 9 min. In the crash of Pan American Flight 759, two impulsive
microbursts occurred in approximately the same location within a
period of about 7 min. For still higher downdraft fluxes the vortices
generated become part of a larger scale circulation that has a much
longer lifetime than each vortex element. Such was the situation at
Dallas-Fort Worth during the crash of Delta Flight 191 as reported by
Fujita (1986) and Caracena et al. (1986).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>4. FORECASTING MICROBURSTS</H3>

<P>A great variety of environments can produce microbursts. Of
particular interest are two extreme types in which microbursts can
occur in large numbers
(<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_08.JPG">Fig.
8</A>). One is the extremely dry environment in which moist
convection is just barely possible, and the other is the extremely
wet environment, which can produce microbursts embedded in very heavy
rain.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>a. The dry extreme</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The dry convective environment was first described by Braham
(1952) and Krumm (1954) for the Western Plateau region of the United
States. Brown et al. (1982) extended this discussion and presented
the following conceptual model for the Front Range area of Colorado:
In the extremely dry environment, where moist convection is just
barely possible, cumulus clouds with very high bases form in a more
protected environment that is nearly saturated at about 3 km (9800
ft) above the surface; below this high-based cloud layer there is a
deep, dry adiabatic layer; dew point depressions are higher nearer
the surface where they may approach 30<SUP>o</SUP>C
(86<SUP>o</SUP>F). Examples of dry microburst soundings are presented
in
<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_09a.JPG">Fig.
9a</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_09b.JPG">Fig.
9b</A>. Wakimoto (1985) discussed the environmental characteristics
of dry microbursts. Caracena et al. (1983) and Caracena and Flueck
(1987a, b) discussed forecasting techniques for this type of dry
extreme microburst that are based on linear predictive models and
discriminate function analysis. Of all the microburst-producing
situations, the dry extreme is probably the best understood.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>b. The wet extreme</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The wet extreme in microburst environments has not been studied in
the same detail as the dry extreme, but the pattern has been
recognized and noted (Fig. 8).
<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_10.JPG">Figure
10</A> shows a typical sounding pattern for a wet microburst. The wet
microburst environment is marked by a deep, nearly saturated layer
with a nearly moist pseudoadiabatic lapse rate that is topped by an
elevated dry layer. The equivalent potential temperature of the dry
layer is cold enough and the layer is sufficiently high above the
surface that, when it is reduced to its wet bulb temperature by
saturation and mixed (in equal parts) with the warm updraft, there is
still enough negatively buoyant potential energy to drive a severe
downdraft through the sinking of such a mixed parcel to the surface.
This method of computing the downdraft potential is a modified form
of a technique proposed by Foster (1958) and described further by
Caracena and Maier (1987). Foster used the fixed layer between 700
and 500 mb to compute the downdraft potential energy, whereas
Caracena and Maier used floating levels that center the dry layer on
the potentially coolest air.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>c. Intermediate environment</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In Texas and other states eastward along the coast of the Gulf of
Mexico microbursts occur in environments that fit neither the wet nor
dry conceptual models presented above, but rather have some
characteristics of both. The reconstructed sounding for Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport (DFW) is typical for such an environment
(<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_11.JPG">Fig.
11</A>; Caracena et al. 1986). Read (See Sohl et al. 1987) analyzed
soundings for microburst events in northern Texas having similar
soundings and found the following common characteristics, which in
combination should be considered indicators of microburst potential.
</P>

<OL>
   <LI>Large positive area.
   
   <LI>Little or no capping inversion.
   
   <LI>A dry adiabatic lapse rate layer, at least 1500 m (5000 ft)
   deep, below the cloud condensation level.
   
   <LI>A moist midtropospheric layer between 1500 m (5000 ft) and
   4600 m (15,000 ft).
   
   <LI>An elevated dry layer above 4600 m (15,000 ft).
</OL>

<P>These sounding characteristics indicate an intermediate microburst
environment in which subcloud evaporation is still quite capable of
producing a microburst, but in which the absolute humidity is high
enough to produce very heavy rain as well. Further, in an
intermediate environment, unlike the situation in the dry microburst
environment, the potential, strong buoyancy in cumulonimbi can lead
to graupel and hail formation that may add additional cooling and
other not-well-understood processes that may enhance the downdraft.
In addition, the presence of an elevated dry layer may be favorable
for downdraft initiation due to entrainment of air from the dry
layer.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>d. Forecasting microburst velocity from the local
sounding</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Maximum downdraft speeds can be estimated from local sounding
data. Srivistava (1985), for example, developed a one-dimensional
evaporatively driven downdraft model that uses such parameters as
raindrop size distributions, rain-water mixing ratios, and sub-cloud
lapse rates to predict the maximum velocity in a downdraft. This
model indicates that the downdraft maximizes when rainwater with a
high mixing ratio is dispersed as very small drops and falls into a
deep dry-adiabatic sub-cloud layer. A simpler model, presented by
Wakimoto (1985), estimates the maximum downdraft speed for a dry
microburst from sounding and mesoscale network data. Caracena and
Maier (1987) modified Foster's (1958) technique to estimate the
maximum downdraft speed for a wet microburst from local sounding data
alone. The most useful results for forecasters, however, would be
some relatively simple index for estimating potential downdraft
strengths from conventional sounding and surface data. At present the
authors know of no sure index for this purpose.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>5. VISUAL IDENTIFICATION OF MICROBURSTS</H3>

<P>Photographic documentation combined with theoretical treatment
(Sec. 2) furnishes a powerful basis for visually identifying
microbursts. Skill in such identification is important for pilots,
controllers, and weather observers; identification of microbursts may
be the final line of defense in avoiding a microburst-related
accident or disaster.</P>

<P>Visual identification may be affected by the observer's perception
of size and distance. As defined by Fujita (1985), a microburst is a
downburst having a horizontal dimension at the surface no greater
than 4 km (2.2 n mi). The spotter may be unsure of the exact
horizontal dimension of a downburst that is seen. Dynamically,
however, there may be little or no difference on an aircraft between
a strong downburst with 5-km (2.7-n mi) diameter and a weak
microburst. In some cases, such as the one reported by Caracena and
Maier (1987), a downburst may initially reach the surface as a
microburst (or perhaps several microbursts) and subsequently expand
into a larger scale downburst (macroburst). Indeed, it is conceivable
that the parent storm could continue to develop into a supercell
storm or squall line, resulting in the downburst's developing
continuously into a large-scale gust front. The classification of an
event as a microburst, macroburst, or gust front is a matter of
judgment on the part of the spotter. The need for such judgment is
not unprecedented. Trained observers are currently asked to estimate
cloud height, degree of cloud cover, visibility, etc. Thus the
spotter may be sure that a downburst is a microburst because its size
can be estimated relative to features of known scales, such as a grid
of roads 1 mile (1.6 km) apart, a copse of trees, or a row of
telephone poles. Even when not certain whether an event is a
microburst or macroburst, the spotter can always call it simply a
downburst.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>a. Dry microbursts</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Figure 6 depicts a typical dry-microburst-producing storm that has
a high base and is producing little (&lt;0.25 cm, or &lt;0.1 in) or
no surface rain. In such extremely dry situations, the storms may not
produce lightning even though the high-based cumulus clouds have a
fibrous appearance and a prominent anvil
(<A HREF="http://www-frd.fsl.noaa.gov/mab/microburst/Fig_d.jpg">Fig.
12</A>).</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_13.JPG">Figure
13</A> shows a typical dry microburst that is just beginning to
spread out over the surface. The microburst is rendered visible by an
expanding ring of dust under a virga shaft descending from a
high-based cumulonimbus. The precipitation largely evaporates before
reaching the surface, so the surface rainfall is probably no more
than a trace. As the microburst pictured in Fig 13 developed, the
ring of dust spread out over the surface
(<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_16.JPG">Fig.
14</A>). A photograph by Fujita (1985) in Fig. 15 shows the typical,
expanded ring of dust at close range. Very close to the site of a dry
microburst, blowing dust might be seen but only a portion of the ring
might be visible (
<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_16.JPG">Fig.
16</A>).</P>

<P>The observer must be especially watchful for dry microburst
conditions that at first glance may present a fair-weather appearance
(Fig. 17). About 20 minutes after the photograph in
<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_17a.JPG">Fig.
17a</A> was taken, dry microbursts began to raise clouds of dust in
the area
(<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_17b.JPG">Fig.
17b</A>). Anvils of large dry-line thunderstorms may also produce
high-level virga
(<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_18.JPG">Fig.
18</A>) that can result in dry microbursts at rather large distances
from the parent hail-storm and its associated heavy radar echo. In
this case pilots and others watching weather conditions on their
radar scopes could have easily misjudged the weather hazards in areas
far from the storm's heavy radar echo. By themselves radar echoes
therefore may be very misleading, and it may take Doppler radar or
knowledgeable observers to spot the danger of a dry microburst.</P>

<P>There is, of course, a continuous range of weather condition
between the dry and wet extremes of microburst-producing
environments. High-based cumulonimbi may produce light but measurable
rain at the surface and raise clouds of blowing dust, as in
<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_19.JPG">Fig.
19</A> where a rain shower has spawned a "gustnado" (gust front
tornado) in the path of an approaching aircraft. High-based
cumulonimbi may also produce heavy rain.
<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_20.JPG">Figure
20</A> gives visual evidence of a rain-embedded microburst: strong
winds at the base of the rain shaft have spread precipitation well
beyond the edge of the rain shaft aloft, forming a sort of low-level
foot shape extending left of the rain shaft. Further, note the
suggestion of a precipitation upward curl near the toe end of the
foot.</P>

<P>High-based thunderstorms with heavy rain should be of particular
concern in air safety since they signal a deep mixed layer, with a
high lapse rate, and plenty of precipitation to fuel a strong
downdraft through the cooling-phase changes of hydrometeors. For
example, at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport a thunderstorm
based about 3 km (1.6 n mi) above the surface produced intense
windshear that caused Delta Flight 191 to crash (see Caracena et al.,
1986).</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>b. Wet microbursts</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Low-based clouds also produce heavy rain with foot-shaped evidence
of an embedded microburst. The scenes in Fig. 21 show precipitation
blowing well under the rain-free cloud base
(<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_21a.JPG">Fig.
21a</A>) where the wind is picking up a curl of dust from a plowed
field. Subsequently the dust plume is carried off to the left of the
picture
(<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_21b.JPG">Fig.
21b</A>) as the rain shaft advances to the left. Note that the rain
shaft is most opaque near the ground. A strong downdraft conveys rain
toward the surface at a much faster rate than it can fall at terminal
velocity through still air. As the downdraft approaches the ground it
decelerates in the vertical, allowing a heavy load of water to
accumulate above the ground. This results in an opaque low-lying base
of the rain shaft (Fig. 21b). A descending wet microburst may first
appear as a darkened mass of rain descending through light rain. For
example, Fig. 22 shows a descending, high-density globular mass of
rain
(<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_22a.JPG">Fig.
22a</A>), and a clearing out of precipitation in its wake
(<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_22b.JPG">Fig.
22b</A>). Such a globular mass of rain is one visual indicator of a
potential microburst.</P>

<P>A storm with moderate to heavy rain is also a potential source of
wet microbursts. In Fig. 23, for example, the telltale sign of an
embedded microburst (or perhaps a larger scale downburst) is a curved
plume of dust that is raised over dry ground ahead of the shower
(<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_23a.JPG">Fig.
23a</A>, center bottom) and grows rapidly
(<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_23b.JPG">Fig.
23b</A>). In wetter conditions, however, the soil may not be dry
enough to furnish this visible clue, and instead a spray of raindrops
may delineate the microburst. Such evidence is furnished by the spray
of raindrops visible in
<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_24.JPG">Fig.
24</A>. However, the maturing cell has a low cloud base, and tall
vertical development, which suggests a localized downdraft rather
than a gust front. The rain shaft leans outward under a lowered
portion of the rain-free cloud base where a plume of either light
dust or rain spray outlines swirling outflow that cloud strengthen
into a microburst. The situation is much clearer in
<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_25.JPG">Fig.
25</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_26.JPG">Fig.
26</A> where the outrush of strong winds near the surface produces a
well-defined foot shape at the bottom of the rain shaft.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>c. Difficult cases</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Sometimes it is very difficult to recognize the presence of
microbursts. For example, the narrow rain shafts in
<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figure_27.JPG">Fig.
27</A> look normal at first glance, but closer inspection reveals
what appear to be upward curls near the surface. Upward curls on the
edges of narrow rain shafts may be indicating embedded microbursts
with vortex circulations that carry a spray of raindrops back up
toward the cloud.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>6. SUMMARY PHOTOGRAPHS</H3>

<P>The casual observer would expect dry microbursts to occur in arid
or semi-arid portions of the country, and wet microbursts in humid
areas. In addition, results of field experiments such as JAWS
indicate that microbursts are normally midafternoon, midsummer
phenomena. However, there are exceptions. For example, dry
microbursts from high-based convection have been observed (Smith
1986) near Wichita, Kansas, and near Chicago ( Fujita 1985; both
humid areas), and wet microbursts have been observed in arid Tucson,
Arizona. The Tucson microburst was also exceptional because it
occurred at night. The Tucson microburst and a typical midafternoon
wet microburst in Wichita are compared in
<A HREF="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/~doswell/microbursts/Figures.html">Figs.
28 and 29</A>. Both have the characteristic precipitation curl
tracing out the vortex-ring circulation that surrounds the
concentrated downdraft within the rain shaft, indicating that no
matter when they occur, dynamically they are the same beast and just
as deadly.</P>

<P>In any part of the country there is some statistical mix of wet
and dry microbursts at a distribution of time and season that extends
beyond the normal range. Therefore observers should not reject an
observation of a microburst because of its timing or because it may
be an exotic type. Wherever and whenever it occurs, and regardless of
its type, a microburst can cause an airplane crash, and should be
taken seriously.</P>
