<H1>Interstellar Medium</H1>
This set of notes by Nick Strobel covers: the interstellar medium--the effect
of dust, emission nebulae, 21 cm radiation, mapping galactic structure, and 
molecules.These notes will be in outline form to aid in
distinguishing various concepts. As a way to condense the text down I'll
often use phrases instead of complete sentences. The vocabulary terms are
italicized.

<H2><A NAME="A1.1"> Interstellar Medium (ISM)</A></H2>
<H4><A HREF="#INDEXA1.1">Index</A></H4>

Stuff between the stars. 10-15% of the visible mass of the Galaxy. 99% of the ISM mass is gas; 1% dust. ``So what?'' Why do we worry about the interstellar medium? The interstellar medium affects starlight and stars are 
formed from ISM!
<H3>A. <A NAME="A1.1.1">Dust</A></H3>
<em>Dust</em>-about the size of the wavelength blue light or smaller. 
Water ice, graphite (Carbon), Silicon in highly flattened flakes or needles. 
Effects of dust on light:
<OL>
<H4><A NAME="A1.1.1.1"><em>Extinction</em></A></H4>
<LI> <em>Extinction</em>--dimming of starlight at all wavelengths. In 1930 R.J. 
Trumpler plots angular diameter of clusters vs. distance to cluster. Distance 
found from inverse square law of brightness. IF clusters all have nearly same 
<b>linear</b> diameter <em>s</em>, 
then the angular diameter should equal a constant size / distance 
(<I>theta = s/D</i>). But he 
found a <b>systematic</b> increase of the linear size of the 
clusters with distance. Unreasonable! It would mean that nature had put the
Sun at a special place where the size of the clusters was the smallest. More 
reasonable: the Sun is in a typical spot. It's simply that more distant 
clusters have more stuff between us and cluster so that they appear fainter
(farther away) than they really are. Extinction caused by scattering of light 
out of the line-of-sight--less light reaches us.
<H4><A NAME="A1.1.1.2"><em>Reddening</em></A></H4>
<H4><A HREF="#INDEXA1.1">Index</A></H4>
<LI> <em>Reddening</em>--extinction depends on wavelength: amount of extinction is approximately a constant 
/ wavelength (<em>E ~ 1/<img alt="lambda" src="/Symb/lambda.gif"></em>). 
Bluer wavelengths scattered more than redder wavelengths. 
1/<IMG SRC="/Symb/lambda.gif" ALT="lambda"> behavior says that 
the dust size must be about the wavelength of 
light (on the order of <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/Symb/10-5.gif" ALT="10^-5"> 
cm). Less blue light reaches us so object appears redder than it should. 
Trumpler showed that a given spectral type of star 
becomes <b>increasingly</b> redder with distance. Same sort of process at work 
to make the Sun appear redder when it is close to the horizon. Dust and gas
molecules in the air scatters out the bluer colors of sunlight from your 
line-of-sight. When Sun close to horizon, this effect is enhanced (light is 
going through more air).
</OL>
<H3>B. <A NAME="A1.1.2">Gas</A></H3>
<H4><A HREF="#INDEXA1.1">Index</A></H4>
 About 90% Hydrogen, 10% Helium, and traces of other elements. 
Observe Hydrogen in ionized, neutral atomic, and molecular forms. At visible 
wavelengths dust has greater effect on light than gas. Looking at spectral 
lines of binary, see narrow lines that do not move and other broader lines 
shifting as stars orbit each other. The narrow lines are from gas in the ISM.
<OL>
<H4><A NAME="A1.1.2.1"><em>H II Regions</em></A></H4>
<LI> <em>H II Regions</em>--fluorescence of hydrogen atoms. Ultraviolet light 
from hot O &amp; B stars absorbed by the Hydrogen gas and re-emitted mostly at 
visible wavelengths, primarily 6563 &#197;(red color). Each UV photon produces a 
visible photon. O &amp; B stars only found in regions of star formation (know 
why?). H II region spectra much simpler than star spectra-easier to decipher. 
Stuff making stars is mostly Hydrogen and Helium. Distribution of H II regions 
is in spiral pattern. O &amp; B are spiral tracers also. The ``II'' of H II means 
that Hydrogen is missing one electron. A He III nebula would be Helium gas with
two missing electrons. A H I nebula would be neutral atomic Hydrogen.
<H4><A NAME="A1.1.2.2"><em>21 cm</em></A></H4>
<H4><A HREF="#INDEXA1.1">Index</A></H4>
<LI><em>21 cm</em>--emission line at wavelength 21 cm produced by neutral 
<b>atomic</b> Hydrogen. In 1944 van de Hulst predicts it. Hydrogen in space is 
in ground state. Electron moving around proton has spin parallel (same 
direction) as proton or opposite (anti-parallel). Anti-parallel is slightly 
lower energy state. Remember that atoms always want to be in the lowest energy 
state possible. Sometimes Hydrogen atoms collide and the spins are re-aligned. 
Eventually (on average few million years) the electron flips its spin to get in 
lowest energy state. Low energy photon (frequency 1420.4 MHz which is at 
wavelength 21.1 cm) emitted. This is a RARE transition, but there is lots of 
Hydrogen in space! Enough to make noticeable amount of 21 cm radiation. 
Milky Way (our galaxy) has about 3 billion solar masses of H I gas with about 
70% of that further out in galaxy from the Sun. Most of the H I gas in disk is 
located within 220 pc from the midplane of the disk. What's very nice is that 
21 cm radiation is not blocked by dust!!
<DL COMPACT><DT>a.
<DD> Find density of atomic Hydrogen along line of sight from intensity of 
21 cm line. 
<DT>b.
<DD> <em>Rotation curve</em>--plot of rotation speed vs. distance from 
Galaxy center. <b>We assume that the gas clouds move in the plane of the disk 
on circular orbits.</b> Jan Oort 1927 finds stars closer to center complete 
greater fraction of their orbit in a given time than stars farther out from 
center--<em>differential rotation</em> (different <b>angular</b> speeds). Look at 
Doppler velocities of Hydrogen gas along different lines of sight. Maximum 
doppler velocity at distance = (solar distance) <i>x</i> sin(galactic longitude). 
Observe maximum doppler velocity along different lines of sight to get rotation 
curve.
<DT>c.
<DD> Map out Galaxy's structure. 21 cm line profile has several 
Doppler-shifted peaks that are narrow and well-defined. IF the rotation curve 
is already known, then we can use the doppler speed of peaks to get the 
distance to the Hydrogen producing each peak. Use intensity of peak to get 
density. Get spiral pattern in a thin disk for almost all of Galaxy! See 
picture below:

<H4><A NAME="A1.1.2.3">Molecules</A></H4>
<H4><A HREF="#INDEXA1.1">Index</A></H4>
<LI> Other molecules: <IMG SRC="/Symb/h2.gif" ALT="H_2">, CO, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/Symb/h2o.gif" ALT="water"> OH, NH_3, SiO, <IMG SRC="/Symb/co_2.gif" ALT="CO_2">, 100+ other 
molecules, many of which have Carbon in them (organic). Most of the molecules 
are  <IMG SRC="/Symb/h2.gif" ALT="H_2"> and CO. 
Molecular clouds:
<DL COMPACT><DT>a.
<DD> Most of the molecules in the ISM are clumped together into clouds
with masses anywhere from just a few solar masses to over a million solar
masses with radii ranging from a few pc to over 100 pc. Milky Way has about 2.5 
billion solar masses of molecular gas with
about 70% of it in a ring at 4-8 kpc distance from the center. (The Sun is
about 8 kpc from the galactic center.) Not much molecular gas at 1-3 kpc
distance from center. About 15% of total molecular gas mass is located close
to galactic center within 1.5 kpc from the center. Most of the <IMG SRC="/Symb/h2.gif" ALT="H_2">
gas is clumped in the spiral arms within the disk and stays within 120 pc of
the disk midplane. <b>Stars form in the molecular clouds.</b>
<DT>b.
<DD> <IMG SRC="/Symb/h2.gif" ALT="H_2"> absorption 
lines detected in ultraviolet. However, gas and dust 
become so thick in a molecular cloud that ultraviolet extinction is too large 
to accurately measure all of the 
<IMG SRC="/Symb/h2.gif" ALT="H_2"> in the interior of 
the cloud. 
Fortunately, we see evidence of a correlation between amount of CO and 
<IMG SRC="/Symb/h2.gif" ALT="H_2"> so 
we use the easily detected CO radio emission lines (at 2.6 and 1.3 mm) to infer 
the amount of <IMG SRC="/Symb/h2.gif" ALT="H_2">. CO 
emission caused by <IMG SRC="/Symb/h2.gif" ALT="H_2"> 
molecules colliding with CO molecules. More <IMG SRC="/Symb/h2.gif" ALT="H_2"> 
means more collisions which means more CO emission.
<DT>c.
<DD> Is one gas cloud actually made of many smaller gas clouds? Some say
that 90% of <IMG SRC="/Symb/h2.gif" ALT="H_2"> locked 
up in 5000 Giant Molecular Clouds with masses greater
than <IMG SRC="/Symb/10+5msol.gif" ALT="10^5 solar masses"> 
and diameters greater than 20 pc with the monster ones 
(diameters greater than 50 pc and having more than a million solar masses) 
making up 50% of the total mass. Others say the giants are actually made of 
smaller clouds.
