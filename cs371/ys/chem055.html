<A NAME=pchem></A>Physical Chemistry&nbsp; (Tune: "The Little Drummer Boy")

&nbsp;

Come, they told me, to Physical Chem (Heisenberg, Heisenberg, Heisenberg)

You'll be unsure all year in Physical Chem (Heisenberg, Heisenberg, Heisenberg)

Is light like a ball or is it like a jump rope (Heisenberg, Heisenberg, Heisenberg)

With all these crazy ideas I really can't cope

There is no hope

Feel like a dope (Heisenberg, Heisenberg, Heisenberg)

&nbsp;

I know I'll never pass this frustrating course,

Physical Chem

&nbsp;

En-tro-py is alive in Physical Chem (delta S delta S delta S)

Learn all that thermo jive in Physical Chem (delta S delta S delta S)

Delta G, H, U, dq and T delta S (delta S delta S delta S)

Laws zero through three, that seems to me an excess

My life is a mess

I must confess

I hate Physical Chem

&nbsp;

Don't, make waves they said in Physical Chem (Psi Psi Psi)

Schrodinger's not dead in Physical Chem (Psi Psi Psi)

Complex wavefunctions are so hard to make (Psi Psi Psi)&nbsp;

This quantum weirdness just gives me a headache

Give me a break

Why must I take

Physical Chem

&nbsp;

I'll get an M-B-A, not a P-h-D

Thanks to Physical Chem&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<A NAME=orgo></A>Organic Synthesis&nbsp; (Tune: "I Don't Know How to Love Him")

&nbsp;

I don't know how to make it

Should I stir, should I shake it

I don't care, the flask's not tared

In the past few days, when I made my stuff

It might be something else.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I just don't understand this

I don't see why it stops there

An amine, just an amine

And I've made so many, amines before

In oh so many ways.&nbsp; It's just one more.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Should I spin it down?&nbsp; Should I dry it out?

Should I try a base?&nbsp; I could scream and shout

I never thought I'd come to this.

What's it all about?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

All my lab work is now micro

I can't even see my product

It might be there -- but I don't care

SN1 or SN2 -- I don't know what to do

I'll simply sit and watch, for a little while

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Should I heat it more?&nbsp; Should I TLC?

Run an NMR?&nbsp; Why's it always me?

I never thought I'd come to this.

What's it all about?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I just don't know how to make it.

Maybe I can simply fake it

I don't care.&nbsp; My prof would swear.

She'd rant, she'd rave, but what the hell

She wouldn't have to know.&nbsp; I'll fool her so.

<A NAME=ag></A>Silver One-Pot Song (with D. Davenport)&nbsp;&nbsp; (Tune: "Silver Bells")

&nbsp;

Silver nitrate, in your one-pot, add bicarbonate say,

And at once there's a feeling of winter,

Then hydroxide, makes it muddy, until chloride in turn

Changes mud into white curds and whey.

&nbsp;

Silver ions, silver ions,

It's one-pot time in the city,

Ring-a-ling, re-act-ing,

If you'll just do it our way.

&nbsp;

Pour ammonia, in your one-pot, see the curds go away,

They return when some bromide is added,

Get the hypo, from the darkroom, watch them vanish from view

And the beaker becomes crystal clear.

&nbsp;

Silver ions, silver ions,

It's one-pot time in the city,

Ring-a-ling, re-act-ing,

If you'll just do it our way.

&nbsp;

Take some iodide, then some cyanide, in your one-pot we mean,

See the solids, appearing and going;

Lastly sulfide, smelly sulfide, changes day into night,

And the tarnish will never come clean.

&nbsp;

Silver ions, silver ions,

It's one-pot time in the city,

Ring-a-ling, re-act-ing,

If you'll just do it our way.

&nbsp;

<A NAME=fe></A>Iron&nbsp; (Tune: Frankie and Johnny)&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Iron two and citrate they complex&nbsp;

A light yellow color they form&nbsp;

Add some sodium hydroxide and a dark green solid is formed&nbsp;

But that's alright, we'll soon make it clear&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Next add our old friend peroxide&nbsp;

Now we're up to iron three&nbsp;

Excess chloride, when acidified, its the prettiest yellow you'll see

Then salicylate, that purple color's just great&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When Frankie shot Johnny the heme flowed&nbsp;

And soon that old lecher was dead&nbsp;

When we add thiocyanate, the iron turns blood red&nbsp;

They're not the same, but they're in the same vein&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Hexacyanoferrate&nbsp;

Forms a complex with iron plus two&nbsp;

Then oxidize to Prussian blue, a complex that's complex its true&nbsp;

Then hydroxide and then sulfide&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This part of our story is ended&nbsp;&nbsp;

We hope that you liked it a lot&nbsp;

To teach some real hot chemistry, you should do it in one pot&nbsp;&nbsp;

But we're not through, in fact there's much more to do

&nbsp;

<A NAME=lehrer></A>This is an additional verse to Tom Lehrer's "The Elements" that picks up at the ending to his

version, and adds information on the elements now known (even at Harvard) which

had not been identified in 1959

&nbsp;

Since Tom Lehrer wrote this song way back in nineteen fifty nine

New elements are known, they now number more than one-oh-nine

&nbsp;

There's 103, where Lehrer left off, the element Lawrencium

And for awhile they gave the ones that followed names nonsensium

Like 104 which for a time was known as unnilquadrium

But now we know that it was named for Ernest Rutherfordium

And 105 we Otto know officially as Hahnium

And 107 has been named for that great Dane NielsBohrium

Once unniloctium, the next one's now called simply Hessium

If Napoleon named them all then we'd have Emporessium

The second woman honored gives us 109, Meitnerium

Her contributions were for many years just viewed as secondarium

This last guy's work is just too good for namers to ignorium

Now 106 forever after will be called Seaborgium

&nbsp;

They've claimed 110 and 111, from just one atom at a time

The periodic table grows, from work both high powered and sublime&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<A NAME=ni></A>Nickel One-Pot Song (Tune: "Five-Foot Two")

&nbsp;

Nickel two of greenish hue

Add some chloride, do, do, do

It turns yellow, you know it's d eight.

(and it's a tetrahedron)

&nbsp;

There's lots of green, then an ammine

A deep blue color as you've seen

An octahedral complex now.

&nbsp;

At high pH with DMG

A scarlet solid starts to form

Based on a square, but please beware

Extended bonding is the norm

&nbsp;

We're almost through with nickel two

Add some sulfide oh PU!

Our nickel one-pot's done with now.

&nbsp;

</B><A HREF="#index"><B>return to index

</B></A><B>&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<A NAME=cu></A>Copper One-Pot Song&nbsp; (Tune: "Copper Kettle")

&nbsp;

Get you some copper metal

Maybe some copper foil;

Toss in some nitric acid

And watch the one-pot boil.

&nbsp;

Now add some sodium bromide

To give an emerald green

A tetrahedral complex

The prettiest we've seen.

&nbsp;

Next oxalate and carbonate

Both solids - kinda blue

But ammonia clears it all up

As you knew that it would do.

&nbsp;

We've almost finished copper

A few more steps it's true

We'll blacken our pot with sulfide

And once we do we're through.

&nbsp;

</B></A><B>&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<A NAME=mn></A>Manganese One-Pot Song (Tune: "Jealously" (with slight modification))

&nbsp;

Man-gan-ese, Your colors surely please

The purple of passion, the blue-green of fashion

From three -to seven, an artist's palette's heaven

Plus two is colorless, the spin just can't change I guess

&nbsp;

Start with per-man-ga-nate reduce it with bisulfite,

Add sulfuric. acid m n o two its black as the night

And down to three

And red you'll see

Dear old plus two

Lets all light through

There's more to do

&nbsp;

Bismuthate, it causes oxida-

Tion back to the seven state

Dear old permanganate

&nbsp;

</B><A HREF="#index"><B>return to index

</B></A><B>&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<A NAME=cr></A>Chromium One Pot Song (Tune: "O'Tannenbaum")

&nbsp;

O'chromium, O'chromium

We'll start out with the plus three state

O'chromium, O'chromium

To oxidize will be our fate

&nbsp;

Plus three what colors, what a range

But ligands show such slow exchange

Peroxide will our savior be

We're done with thee o' chromium three

&nbsp;

And now we're up to four and five

We hope to finish at chromate

The species we find in between

On that we'll have to cogitate

&nbsp;

We play around with peroxide

Yellow to blue when acidified

We're almost done, its much too late

Throw it all down as lead chromate

&nbsp;

</B><A HREF="#index"><B>return to index

</B></A><B>&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<A NAME=co></A>Cobalt One Pot Song (Tune: "When Johnny Comes Marching Home")

&nbsp;

We started out with cobalt two hurrah, hurrah

In ethanol pink turns to blue hurrah, hurrah

Then back to pink, add carbonate, a lavender precipitate

Which turns to blue then green, its true, with N A OH

&nbsp;

Then add some H C L. and it all turns back to pink

Then add some tartrate. careful here, what do you think

Will happen if we oxidize, green!, can you believe your eyes

Some ferrocyanide, then bipy and bor-o-hydride

&nbsp;

We're almost done we've had such fun - hurrah, hurrah

We've got the cobalt down to one - hurrah, hurrah

What shall we mix, into our stew, add some sulfide wouldn't you

A long way to go for a black precipitate

&nbsp;

</B><A HREF="#index"><B>return to index

</B></A><B>&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<A NAME=v></A>Vanadium One Pot Song (Tune: "I Don't Know How To Love Him")

&nbsp;

I don't know how to make it

No one's watching I'll just fake it

I'm so glum - vanadium

Why can't you be, all in plus three

With colors bright and gay - but there's no way

&nbsp;

All the faculty had warned me

I'd regret my decision

There's oxy ions - at several states

And many of the vanadates are polymers no less - oh what a mess

&nbsp;

But I reduced it down, ammonium vanadate

Thru green and blue, then to the plus two state

The colors fell right into line

I felt they were all mine - it was so fine

&nbsp;

Now I'll oxidize to five or six

I'll use peroxide or permanganate

And soon I'll stop, just one more drop

We've come full circle, its been such fun

Stand proud your time has come - vanadium

&nbsp;
