<TITLE>Notes on the Interstellar Medium for Asph 503</TITLE>

<p><img src="http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/line.blue.gif"></p>

<p>This page gives links that are useful for the students in 
ASPH503, the Interstellar Medium course here at U of Calgary.</p>

<p>Below are links to PDF forms of my class notes; the PDF conversion 
   is not always 100% correct for some reason that I have not been able 
   to determine.  However I think the files can be printed if desired.</p>

<p>PDF (portable document format) is from Adobe Systems, and the 
   <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/main.html">Adobe Acrobat</a> 
   reader is needed to view them.</p>

<p>The notes more or less replace a textbook, since the field is moving 
   so rapidly and all the available textbooks that I know of are out of 
   date.  I have much more emphasis on molecular cloud properties and 
   star formation than is normal in ISM textbooks, since these areas 
   are two of the currently most active aspects of ISM research.  The 
   same is true of extragalactic ISM research, but there I was only able 
   to put in a small amount of material mostly for comparison with the 
   situation in the Galaxy.</p>

<p>One thing that I could not make for the notes was a copy of the Columbia 
   CO map of the Galaxy by Dame et al.  This is refered to in the notes and 
   there are some filler pages where I photocopied the original large-scale
   map from T. M. Dame et al. (1987; ApJ, 322, 706-720).  A nice colour poster 
   of this map is available from Dr. Dame.  Some WWW images from the 
   poster are found <a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/mmw/poster.html">
   at this link</a></p>

<p>These notes are free for the downloading, but I stress that they are 
   by no means perfect or even polished.  Some parts of them may reflect 
   my ignorance rather than my knowledge.  It was educational for me to 
   put the notes together; things have changed a lot since I took this 
   sort of course in 1981.</p>

<p>Including the table of contents, the notes run to almost 300 pages.</p> 

<p>The following are the various sections of my notes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/tofcon.pdf">Table of Contents</a>

<p>The <a href="http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/figs1.html">Figures</a> 
from the notes are available at 
<a href="http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/figs1.html">this link</a>.  
These are a set of GIF or JPEG figures, many from the 
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/">Astronomy Picture of the Day</a>
site.

Most of these figures are taken right off the network, and can be found 
at the APOD site above or in such things as the NOAO WWW pages.  Some of the 
figures are taken from research papers, in which case the references to the 
sources are given in the notes.  They are not always given in the WWW page 
above.

Not all of the figures are in the notes.  The 
<a href="http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/figs1.html">link page</a> also 
has other figures more recent than those that I used in writing the notes 
over the summer and fall of 1999.  While two or three of these were put into 
the notes as the course went on, most are just "free-floating" figures that 
are of interest.

<p>Some examples of molecular spectra taken at JCMT can be found at 
<a href="http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/getspect_jcmt_plot.html">this 
link</a> which uses standard spectra from JCMT.  A few sources have been 
observed in various different molecular lines.  You can choose the spectrum 
to look at by number.  This data is taken from the <a href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/JCMT/">JCMT WWW pages</a>.

<p>I found a small numerical error on page 12 of the notes; the Stromgren
radius value quoted is for an ionizing photon flux of 5e48 per second, and
the notes have the flux as 4e48 per second.  There are bound to be other errors 
in the text that have not been corrected.
