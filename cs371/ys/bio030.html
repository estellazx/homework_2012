volution is the cornerstone of modern biology. It unites all the
fields of biology under one theoretical umbrella. It is not a difficult
concept, but very few people -- the majority of biologists included
-- have a satisfactory grasp of it. One common mistake is believing
that species can be arranged on an evolutionary ladder from
bacteria through "lower" animals, to "higher" animals and, finally,
up to man. Mistakes permeate popular science expositions of
evolutionary biology. Mistakes even filter into biology journals and
texts. For example, Lodish, et. al., in their cell biology text,
proclaim, "It was Charles Darwin's great insight that organisms are all
related in a great chain of being..." In fact, the idea of a great
chain of being, which traces to Linnaeus, was overturned by Darwin's
idea of common descent.

<P>
Misunderstandings about evolution are damaging to the study of
evolution and biology as a whole. People who have a general
interest in science are likely to dismiss evolution as a soft science
after absorbing the pop science nonsense that abounds. The
impression of it being a soft science is reinforced when biologists in
unrelated fields speculate publicly about evolution.

<P>
This is a brief introduction to evolutionary biology. I attempt to
explain basics of the theory of evolution and correct many of the
misconceptions.

  <H2>What is Evolution?</H2>

<P>
Evolution is a change in the gene pool of a population over time. A
gene is a hereditary unit that can be passed on unaltered for many
generations. The gene pool is the set of all genes in a species or
population.

<P>
The English moth, <I>Biston betularia</I>, is a frequently cited example
of observed evolution. [evolution: a change in the gene pool] In this
moth there are two color morphs, light and dark. H. B. D. Kettlewell
found that dark moths constituted less than 2% of the population
prior to 1848. The frequency of the dark morph increased in the years
following. By 1898, the 95% of the moths in Manchester and other
highly industrialized areas were of the dark type. Their frequency
was less in rural areas. The moth population changed from mostly
light colored moths to mostly dark colored moths. The moths' color
was primarily determined by a single gene. [gene: a hereditary
unit] So, the change in frequency of dark colored moths
represented a change in the gene pool. [gene pool: the set all of
genes in a population] This change was, by definition, evolution.

<P>
The increase in relative abundance of the dark type was due to
natural selection. The late eighteen hundreds was the time of
England's industrial revolution. Soot from factories darkened the
birch trees the moths landed on. Against a sooty background, birds
could see the lighter colored moths better and ate more of them.
As a result, more dark moths survived until reproductive age and
left offspring. The greater number of offspring left by dark moths
is what caused their increase in frequency. This is an example of
natural selection.

<P>
Populations evolve. [evolution: a change in the gene pool] In
order to understand evolution, it is necessary to view populations
as a collection of individuals, each harboring a different set
of traits. A single organism is never typical of an entire population
unless there is no variation within that population. Individual
organisms do not evolve, they retain the same genes throughout
their life. When a population is evolving, the ratio of different
genetic types is changing -- each individual organism within
a population does not change. For example, in the previous
example, the frequency of black moths increased; the moths
did not turn from light to gray to dark in concert. The process
of evolution can be summarized in three sentences: Genes mutate.
[gene: a hereditary unit] Individuals are selected. Populations
evolve.

<P>
Evolution can be divided into microevolution and macroevolution.
The kind of evolution documented above is microevolution. Larger
changes, such as when a new species is formed, are called
macroevolution. Some biologists feel the mechanisms of
macroevolution are different from those of microevolutionary
change. Others think the distinction between the two is arbitrary --
macroevolution is cumulative microevolution.

<P>
The word evolution has a variety of meanings. The fact that all
organisms are linked via descent to a common ancestor is often
called evolution. The theory of how the first living organisms
appeared is often called evolution. This should be called abiogenesis.
And frequently, people use the word evolution when they really mean
natural selection -- one of the many mechanisms of evolution.


  <H2>Common Misconceptions about Evolution</H2>


<P>
Evolution can occur without morphological change; and
morphological change can occur without evolution. Humans are
larger now than in the recent past, a result of better diet and
medicine.  Phenotypic changes, like this, induced solely by
changes in environment do not count as evolution because they are
not heritable; in other words the change is not passed on to the
organism's offspring. Phenotype is the morphological, physiological,
biochemical, behavioral and other properties exhibited by a living
organism. An organism's phenotype is determined by its genes and
its environment. Most changes due to environment are fairly
subtle, for example size differences. Large scale phenotypic
changes are obviously due to genetic changes, and therefore are
evolution.

<P>
Evolution is not progress. Populations simply adapt to their current
surroundings. They do not necessarily become better in any absolute
sense over time. A trait or strategy that is successful at one time
may be unsuccessful at another. Paquin and Adams demonstrated this
experimentally. They founded a yeast culture and maintained it for
many generations. Occasionally, a mutation would arise that allowed
its bearer to reproduce better than its contemporaries. These mutant
strains would crowd out the formerly dominant strains. Samples of
the most successful strains from the culture were taken at a
variety of times. In later competition experiments, each strain would
outcompete the immediately previously dominant type in a culture.
However, some earlier isolates could outcompete strains that arose
late in the experiment. Competitive ability of a strain was always
better than its previous type, but competitiveness in a general sense
was not increasing. Any organism's success depends on the behavior of
its contemporaries. For most traits or behaviors there is likely no
optimal design or strategy, only contingent ones. Evolution can be
like a game of paper/scissors/rock.

<P>
Organisms are not passive targets of their environment.  Each
species modifies its own environment. At the least, organisms
remove nutrients from and add waste to their surroundings. Often,
waste products benefit other species. Animal dung is fertilizer for
plants. Conversely, the oxygen we breathe is a waste product of
plants. Species do not simply change to fit their environment; they
modify their environment to suit them as well. Beavers build a
dam to create a pond suitable to sustain them and raise young.
Alternately, when the environment changes, species can migrate
to suitable climes or seek out microenvironments to which they
are adapted.

  <H2>Genetic Variation</H2>

<P>
Evolution requires genetic variation. If there were no dark moths,
the population could not have evolved from mostly light to mostly
dark. In order for continuing evolution there must be mechanisms
to increase or create genetic variation and mechanisms to decrease
it. Mutation is a change in a gene. These changes are the source of
new genetic variation. Natural selection operates on this variation.

<P>
Genetic variation has two components: allelic diversity and non-
random associations of alleles. Alleles are different versions of the
same gene. For example, humans can have A, B or O alleles that
determine one aspect of their blood type. Most animals, including
humans, are diploid -- they contain two alleles for every gene at
every locus, one inherited from their mother and one inherited
from their father. Locus is the location of a gene on a chromosome.
Humans can be AA, AB, AO, BB, BO or OO at the blood group locus.
If the two alleles at a locus are the same type (for instance two
A alleles) the individual would be called homozygous. An
individual with two different alleles at a locus (for example, an
AB individual) is called heterozygous. At any locus there can be
many different alleles in a population, more alleles than any single
organism can possess. For example, no single human can have an A, B
and an O allele.

<P>
Considerable variation is present in natural populations. At 45
percent of loci in plants there is more than one allele in the gene
pool. [allele: alternate version of a gene (created by mutation)] Any
given plant is likely to be heterozygous at about 15 percent of its
loci. Levels of genetic variation in animals range from roughly 15%
of loci having more than one allele (polymorphic) in birds, to over
50% of loci being polymorphic in insects. Mammals and reptiles are
polymorphic at about 20% of their loci - - amphibians and fish are
polymorphic at around 30% of their loci. In most populations, there
are enough loci and enough different alleles that every individual,
identical twins excepted, has a unique combination of alleles.

<P>
Linkage disequilibrium is a measure of association between alleles
of two different genes. [allele: alternate version of a gene] If two
alleles were found together in organisms more often than would be
expected, the alleles are in linkage disequilibrium. If there two loci
in an organism (A and B) and two alleles at each of these loci (A1,
A2, B1 and B2) linkage disequilibrium (D) is calculated as D =
f(A1B1) * f(A2B2) - f(A1B2) * f(A2B1) (where f(X) is the frequency
of X in the population). [Loci (plural of locus): location of a gene on
a chromosome] D varies between -1/4 and 1/4; the greater the
deviation from zero, the greater the linkage. The sign is simply a
consequence of how the alleles are numbered. Linkage
disequilibrium can be the result of physical proximity of the genes.
Or, it can be maintained by natural selection if some combinations
of alleles work better as a team.

<P>
Natural selection maintains the linkage disequilibrium between
color and pattern alleles in <I>Papilio memnon</I>. [linkage
disequilibrium: association between alleles at different loci] In this
moth species, there is a gene that determines wing morphology.
One allele at this locus leads to a moth that has a tail; the other allele
codes for a untailed moth. There is another gene that determines if
the wing is brightly or darkly colored. There are thus four possible
types of moths: brightly colored moths with and without tails, and
dark moths with and without tails. All four can be produced when
moths are brought into the lab and bred. However, only two of
these types of moths are found in the wild: brightly colored moths
with tails and darkly colored moths without tails. The non-random
association is maintained by natural selection. Bright, tailed moths
mimic the pattern of an unpalatable species. The dark morph is
cryptic. The other two combinations are neither mimetic nor cryptic
and are quickly eaten by birds.

<P>
Assortative mating causes a non-random distribution of alleles at a
single locus. [locus: location of a gene on a chromosome] If there are
two alleles (A and a) at a locus with frequencies p and q, the
frequency of the three possible genotypes (AA, Aa and aa) will be
p<sup>2</sup>, 2pq and q<sup>2</sup>, 
respectively. For example, if the frequency of
A is 0.9 and the frequency of a is 0.1, the frequencies of AA, Aa
and aa individuals are: 0.81, 0.18 and 0.01. This distribution is
called the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

<P>
Non-random mating results in a deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg
distribution. Humans mate assortatively according to race; we are
more likely to mate with someone of own race than another. In
populations that mate this way, fewer heterozygotes are found
than would be predicted under random mating. [heterozygote: an
organism that has two different alleles at a locus] A decrease in
heterozygotes can be the result of mate choice, or simply the result
of population subdivision. Most organisms have a limited dispersal
capability, so their mate will be chosen from the local population.


<H1>Evolution within a Lineage </H1>

<P>
In order for continuing evolution there must be mechanisms to
increase or create genetic variation and mechanisms to decrease it.
The mechanisms of evolution are mutation, natural selection,
genetic drift, recombination and gene flow. I have grouped them
into two classes -- those that decrease genetic variation and those
that increase it.

  <H2>Mechanisms that Decrease Genetic Variation</H2>

<A NAME="natsel">
    <H3>Natural Selection </H3>
</A>

<P>
Some types of organisms within a population leave more offspring
than others. Over time, the frequency of the more prolific type will
increase. The difference in reproductive capability is called natural
selection. Natural selection is the only mechanism of adaptive
evolution; it is defined as differential reproductive success of pre-
existing classes of genetic variants in the gene pool.

<P>
The most common action of natural selection is to remove unfit
variants as they arise via mutation. [natural selection: differential
reproductive success of genotypes] In other words, natural
selection usually prevents new alleles from increasing in
frequency. This led a famous evolutionist, George Williams, to say
"Evolution proceeds in spite of natural selection."

<P>
Natural selection can maintain or deplete genetic variation
depending on how it acts. When selection acts to weed out
deleterious alleles, or causes an allele to sweep to fixation, it
depletes genetic variation. When heterozygotes are more fit than
either of the homozygotes, however, selection causes genetic
variation to be maintained. [heterozygote: an organism that has two
different alleles at a locus. | homozygote: an organism that has two
identical alleles at a locus] This is called balancing selection. An
example of this is the maintenance of sickle-cell alleles in human
populations subject to malaria. Variation at a single locus
determines whether red blood cells are shaped normally or sickled.
If a human has two alleles for sickle-cell, he/she develops anemia
-- the shape of sickle-cells precludes them carrying normal levels
of oxygen. However, heterozygotes who have one copy of the
sickle-cell allele, coupled with one normal allele enjoy some
resistance to malaria -- the shape of sickled cells make it harder
for the plasmodia (malaria causing agents) to enter the cell.
Thus, individuals homozygous for the normal allele suffer more
malaria than heterozygotes. Individuals homozygous for the sickle-
cell are anemic. Heterozygotes have the highest fitness of these
three types.  Heterozygotes pass on both sickle-cell and normal
alleles to the next generation. Thus, neither allele can be eliminated
from the gene pool. The sickle-cell allele is at its highest frequency
in regions of Africa where malaria is most pervasive.

<P>
Balancing selection is rare in natural populations. [balancing
selection: selection favoring heterozygotes] Only a handful of other
cases beside the sickle-cell example have been found. At one time
population geneticists thought balancing selection could be a
general explanation for the levels of genetic variation found in
natural populations. That is no longer the case. Balancing selection
is only rarely found in natural populations. And, there are theoretical
reasons why natural selection cannot maintain polymorphisms at
several loci via balancing selection.

<P>
Individuals are selected. The example I gave earlier was an
example of evolution via natural selection. [natural selection:
differential reproductive success of genotypes] Dark colored moths
had a higher reproductive success because light colored moths
suffered a higher predation rate. The decline of light colored alleles
was caused by light colored individuals being removed from the
gene pool (selected against). Individual organisms either reproduce
or fail to reproduce and are hence the unit of selection. One way
alleles can change in frequency is to be housed in organisms with
different reproductive rates. Genes are not the unit of selection
(because their success depends on the organism's other genes as
well); neither are groups of organisms a unit of selection. There are
some exceptions to this "rule," but it is a good generalization.

<P>
Organisms do not perform any behaviors that are for the good of
their species. An individual organism competes primarily with
others of it own species for its reproductive success. Natural
selection favors selfish behavior because any truly altruistic act
increases the recipient's reproductive success while lowering the
donors. Altruists would disappear from a population as the non-
altruists would reap the benefits, but not pay the costs, of
altruistic acts. Many behaviors appear altruistic. Biologists,
however, can demonstrate that these behaviors are only apparently
altruistic. Cooperating with or helping other organisms is often the
most selfish strategy for an animal. This is called reciprocal
altruism. A good example of this is blood sharing in vampire bats.
In these bats, those lucky enough to find a meal will often share
part of it with an unsuccessful bat by regurgitating some blood into
the other's mouth. Biologists have found that these bats form bonds
with partners and help each other out when the other is needy. If a
bat is found to be a "cheater," (he accepts blood when starving, but
does not donate when his partner is) his partner will abandon him.
The bats are thus not helping each other altruistically; they form
pacts that are mutually beneficial.

<P>
Helping closely related organisms can appear altruistic; but this is
also a selfish behavior. Reproductive success (fitness) has two
components; direct fitness and indirect fitness. Direct fitness is a
measure of how many alleles, on average, a genotype contributes
to the subsequent generation's gene pool by reproducing. Indirect
fitness is a measure of how many alleles identical to its own it
helps to enter the gene pool. Direct fitness plus indirect fitness is
inclusive fitness. J. B. S. Haldane once remarked he would gladly
drown, if by doing so he saved two siblings or eight cousins. Each of
his siblings would share one half his alleles; his cousins, one eighth.
They could potentially add as many of his alleles to the gene pool
as he could.

<P>
Natural selection favors traits or behaviors that increase a
genotype's inclusive fitness. Closely related organisms share many
of the same alleles. In diploid species, siblings share on average at
least 50% of their alleles. The percentage is higher if the parents
are related. So, helping close relatives to reproduce gets an
organism's own alleles better represented in the gene pool. The
benefit of helping relatives increases dramatically in highly inbred
species. In some cases, organisms will completely forgo
reproducing and only help their relatives reproduce. Ants, and
other eusocial insects, have sterile castes that only serve the
queen and assist her reproductive efforts. The sterile workers
are reproducing by proxy.

<P>
The words selfish and altruistic have connotations in everyday
use that biologists do not intend. Selfish simply means behaving
in such a way that one's own inclusive fitness is maximized;
altruistic means behaving in such a way that another's fitness is
increased at the expense of ones' own. Use of the words selfish
and altruistic is not meant to imply that organisms consciously
understand their motives.

<P>
The opportunity for natural selection to operate does not induce
genetic variation to appear -- selection only distinguishes between
existing variants. Variation is not possible along every imaginable
axis, so all possible adaptive solutions are not open to populations.
To pick a somewhat ridiculous example, a steel shelled turtle might
be an improvement over regular turtles. Turtles are killed quite a
bit by cars these days because when confronted with danger, they
retreat into their shells -- this is not a great strategy against a two
ton automobile. However, there is no variation in metal content of
shells, so it would not be possible to select for a steel shelled turtle.

<P>
Here is a second example of natural selection. Geospiza fortis lives
on the Galapagos islands along with fourteen other finch species. It
feeds on the seeds of the plant Tribulus cistoides, specializing on
the smaller seeds. Another species, G. Magnirostris, has a larger
beak and specializes on the larger seeds. The health of these bird
populations depends on seed production. Seed production, in turn,
depends on the arrival of wet season. In 1977, there was a
drought. Rainfall was well below normal and fewer seeds were
produced. As the season progressed, the G. fortis population
depleted the supply of small seeds. Eventually, only larger seeds
remained. Most of the finches starved; the population plummeted
from about twelve hundred birds to less than two hundred. Peter
Grant, who had been studying these finches, noted that larger
beaked birds fared better than smaller beaked ones. These larger
birds had offspring with correspondingly large beaks. Thus, there
was an increase in the proportion of large beaked birds in the
population the next generation. To prove that the change in bill size
in Geospiza fortis was an evolutionary change, Grant had to show
that differences in bill size were at least partially genetically based.
He did so by crossing finches of various beak sizes and showing
that a finch's beak size was influenced by its parent's genes. Large
beaked birds had large beaked offspring; beak size was not due to
environmental differences (in parental care, for example).

<P>
Natural selection may not lead a population to have the optimal
set of traits. In any population, there would be a certain
combination of possible alleles that would produce the optimal set
of traits (the global optimum); but there are other sets of alleles
that would yield a population almost as adapted (local optima).
Transition from a local optimum to the global optimum may be
hindered or forbidden because the population would have to pass
through less adaptive states to make the transition. Natural
selection only works to bring populations to the nearest optimal
point. This idea is Sewall Wright's adaptive landscape. This is one
of the most influential models that shape how evolutionary
biologists view evolution.

<P>
Natural selection does not have any foresight.  It only allows
organisms to adapt to their current environment. Structures or
behaviors do not evolve for future utility. An organism adapts to
its environment at each stage of its evolution. As the environment
changes, new traits may be selected for. Large changes in
populations are the result of cumulative natural selection. Changes
are introduced into the population by mutation; the small minority
of these changes that result in a greater reproductive output of
their bearers are amplified in frequency by selection.

<P>
Complex traits must evolve through viable intermediates. For many
traits, it initially seems unlikely that intermediates would be
viable. What good is half a wing? Half a wing may be no good for
flying, but it may be useful in other ways. Feathers are thought to
have evolved as insulation (ever worn a down jacket?) and/or as a
way to trap insects. Later, proto-birds may have learned to glide
when leaping from tree to tree. Eventually, the feathers that
originally served as insulation now became co-opted for use in
flight. A trait's current utility is not always indicative of its past
utility. It can evolve for one purpose, and be used later for another.
A trait evolved for its current utility is an adaptation; one that
evolved for another utility is an exaptation. An example of an
exaptation is a penguin's wing. Penguins evolved from flying
ancestors; now they are flightless and use their wings for
swimming.


    <H3>Common Misconceptions about Selection</H3>

<P>
Selection is not a force in the sense that gravity or the strong
nuclear force is. However, for the sake of brevity, biologists
sometimes refer to it that way. This often leads to some confusion
when biologists speak of selection "pressures." This implies that the
environment "pushes" a population to more adapted state. This is
not the case. Selection merely favors beneficial genetic changes
when they occur by chance -- it does not contribute to their
appearance. The potential for selection to act may long precede the
appearance of selectable genetic variation. When selection is
spoken of as a force, it often seems that it is has a mind of its own;
or as if it was nature personified. This most often occurs when
biologists are waxing poetic about selection. This has no place in
scientific discussions of evolution. Selection is not a guided or
cognizant entity; it is simply an effect.

<P>
A related pitfall in discussing selection is anthropomorphizing on
behalf of living things. Often conscious motives are seemingly
imputed to organisms, or even genes, when discussing evolution.
This happens most frequently when discussing animal behavior.
Animals are often said to perform some behavior because selection
will favor it. This could more accurately worded as "animals that,
due to their genetic composition, perform this behavior tend to be
favored by natural selection relative to those who, due to their
genetic composition, don't." Such wording is cumbersome. To avoid
this, biologists often anthropomorphize. This is unfortunate because
it often makes evolutionary arguments sound silly. Keep in mind
this is only for convenience of expression.

<P>
The phrase "survival of the fittest" is often used synonymously
with natural selection. The phrase is both incomplete and
misleading. For one thing, survival is only one component of
selection -- and perhaps one of the less important ones in many
populations. For example, in polygynous species, a number of males
survive to reproductive age, but only a few ever mate. Males may
differ little in their ability to survive, but greatly in their ability to
attract mates -- the difference in reproductive success stems
mainly from the latter consideration. Also, the word fit is often
confused with physically fit. Fitness, in an evolutionary sense, is
the average reproductive output of a class of genetic variants in a
gene pool. Fit does not necessarily mean biggest, fastest or
strongest.

    <H3>Sexual Selection</H3>

<P>
In many species, males develop prominent secondary sexual
characteristics. A few oft cited examples are the peacock's tail,
coloring and patterns in male birds in general, voice calls in frogs
and flashes in fireflies. Many of these traits are a liability
from the standpoint of survival. Any ostentatious trait or noisy,
attention getting behavior will alert predators as well as potential
mates. How then could natural selection favor these traits?

<P>
Natural selection can be broken down into many components, of
which survival is only one. Sexual attractiveness is a very
important component of selection, so much so that biologists use
the term sexual selection when they talk about this subset of
natural selection.

<P>
Sexual selection is natural selection operating on factors that
contribute to an organism's mating success. Traits that are a
liability to survival can evolve when the sexual attractiveness of a
trait outweighs the liability incurred for survival. A male who lives
a short time, but produces many offspring is much more successful
than a long lived one that produces few. The former's genes will
eventually dominate the gene pool of his species. In many species,
especially polygynous species where only a few males monopolize
all the females, sexual selection has caused pronounced sexual
dimorphism. In these species males compete against other males
for mates. The competition can be either direct or mediated by
female choice. In species where females choose, males compete by
displaying striking phenotypic characteristics and/or performing
elaborate courtship behaviors. The females then mate with the
males that most interest them, usually the ones with the most
outlandish displays. There are many competing theories as to why
females are attracted to these displays.

<P>
The good genes model states that the display indicates some
component of male fitness. A good genes advocate would say that
bright coloring in male birds indicates a lack of parasites. The
females are cueing on some signal that is correlated with some
other component of viability.

<P>
Selection for good genes can be seen in sticklebacks. In these fish,
males have red coloration on their sides. Milinski and Bakker
showed that intensity of color was correlated to both parasite load
and sexual attractiveness. Females preferred redder males. The
redness indicated that he was carrying fewer parasites.

<P>
Evolution can get stuck in a positive feedback loop. Another model
to explain secondary sexual characteristics is called the runaway
sexual selection model. R. A. Fisher proposed that females may
have an innate preference for some male trait before it appears in
a population. Females would then mate with male carriers when
the trait appears. The offspring of these matings have the genes for
both the trait and the preference for the trait. As a result, the
process snowballs until natural selection brings it into check.
Suppose that female birds prefer males with longer than average
tail feathers. Mutant males with longer than average feathers will
produce more offspring than the short feathered males. In the next
generation, average tail length will increase. As the generations
progress, feather length will increase because females do not prefer
a specific length tail, but a longer than average tail. Eventually
tail length will increase to the point were the liability to survival
is matched by the sexual attractiveness of the trait and an equilibrium
will be established. Note that in many exotic birds male plumage is
often very showy and many species do in fact have males with greatly
elongated feathers. In some cases these feathers are shed after the
breeding season.

<P>
None of the above models are mutually exclusive. There are
millions of sexually dimorphic species on this planet and the forms
of sexual selection probably vary amongst them.

    <H3>Genetic Drift</H3>

<P>
Allele frequencies can change due to chance alone. This is called
genetic drift. Drift is a binomial sampling error of the gene pool.
What this means is, the alleles that form the next generation's gene
pool are a sample of the alleles from the current generation. When
sampled from a population, the frequency of alleles differs slightly
due to chance alone.

<P>
Alleles can increase or decrease in frequency due to drift. The average
expected change in allele frequency is zero, since increasing or
decreasing in frequency is equally probable. A small percentage of
alleles may continually change frequency in a single direction for
several generations just as flipping a fair coin may, on occasion,
result in a string of heads or tails. A very few new mutant alleles
can drift to fixation in this manner.

<P>
In small populations, the variance in the rate of change of allele
frequencies is greater than in large populations. However, the
overall rate of genetic drift (measured in substitutions per
generation) is independent of population size. [genetic drift: a
random change in allele frequencies] If the mutation rate is
constant, large and small populations lose alleles to drift at the
same rate. This is because large populations will have more alleles
in the gene pool, but they will lose them more slowly. Smaller
populations will have fewer alleles, but these will quickly cycle
through. This assumes that mutation is constantly adding new
alleles to the gene pool and selection is not operating on any of
these alleles.

<P>
Sharp drops in population size can change allele frequencies
substantially. When a population crashes, the alleles in the
surviving sample may not be representative of the precrash gene
pool. This change in the gene pool is called the founder effect,
because small populations of organisms that invade a new territory
(founders) are subject to this. Many biologists feel the genetic
changes brought about by founder effects may contribute to isolated
populations developing reproductive isolation from their parent
populations. In sufficiently small populations, genetic drift can
counteract selection. [genetic drift: a random change in allele
frequencies] Mildly deleterious alleles may drift to fixation.

<P>
Wright and Fisher disagreed on the importance of drift. Fisher
thought populations were sufficiently large that drift could be
neglected. Wright argued that populations were often divided into
smaller subpopulations. Drift could cause allele frequency
differences between subpopulations if gene flow was small enough.
If a subpopulation was small enough, the population could even
drift through fitness valleys in the adaptive landscape. Then, the
subpopulation could climb a larger fitness hill. Gene flow out of this
subpopulation could contribute to the population as a whole
adapting. This is Wright's Shifting Balance theory of evolution.

<P>
Both natural selection and genetic drift decrease genetic variation.
If they were the only mechanisms of evolution, populations would
eventually become homogeneous and further evolution would be
impossible. There are, however, mechanisms that replace variation
depleted by selection and drift. These are discussed below.

  <H2>Mechanisms that Increase Genetic Variation </H2>


<A NAME="mutation">
    <H3>Mutation</H3>
</A>

<P>
The cellular machinery that copies DNA sometimes makes
mistakes. These mistakes alter the sequence of a gene. This is
called a mutation. There are many kinds of mutations. A point
mutation is a mutation in which one "letter" of the genetic code is
changed to another. Lengths of DNA can also be deleted or inserted
in a gene; these are also mutations. Finally, genes or parts of genes
can become inverted or duplicated. Typical rates of mutation are
between 10<sup>-10</sup> and 10<sup>-12</sup> mutations per base pair of DNA per
generation.

<P>
Most mutations are thought to be neutral with regards to fitness.
(Kimura defines neutral as |s| &lt; 1/2Ne,  where s is the selective
coefficient and Ne is the effective population size.) Only a small
portion of the genome of eukaryotes contains coding segments.
And, although some non-coding DNA is involved in gene regulation
or other cellular functions, it is probable that most base changes
would have no fitness consequence.

<P>
Most mutations that have any phenotypic effect are deleterious.
Mutations that result in amino acid substitutions can change the
shape of a protein, potentially changing or eliminating its function.
This can lead to inadequacies in biochemical pathways or interfere
with the process of development. Organisms are sufficiently
integrated that most random changes will not produce a fitness
benefit. Only a very small percentage of mutations are beneficial.
The ratio of neutral to deleterious to beneficial mutations is
unknown and probably varies with respect to details of the locus in
question and environment.

<P>
Mutation limits the rate of evolution. The rate of evolution can be
expressed in terms of nucleotide substitutions in a lineage per
generation. Substitution is the replacement of an allele by another
in a population. This is a two step process: First a mutation occurs
in an individual, creating a new allele. This allele subsequently
increases in frequency to fixation in the population. The rate of
evolution is k = 2Nvu (in diploids) where k is nucleotide
substitutions, N is the effective population size, v is the rate of
mutation and u is the proportion of mutants that eventually fix in
the population.

<P>
Mutation need not be limiting over short time spans. The rate of
evolution expressed above is given as a steady state equation;
it assumes the system is at equilibrium. Given the time frames
for a single mutant to fix, it is unclear if populations are ever at
equilibrium. A change in environment can cause previously neutral
alleles to have selective values; in the short term evolution can run
on "stored" variation and thus is independent of mutation rate.
Other mechanisms can also contribute selectable variation.
Recombination creates new combinations of alleles (or new alleles)
by joining sequences with separate microevolutionary histories
within a population. Gene flow can also supply the gene pool with
variants. Of course, the ultimate source of these variants is
mutation.

      <H4>The Fate of Mutant Alleles</H4>

<P>
Mutation creates new alleles. Each new allele enters the gene pool
as a single copy amongst many. Most are lost from the gene pool,
the organism carrying them fails to reproduce, or reproduces but does
not pass on that particular allele. A mutant's fate is shared with the
genetic background it appears in.  A new allele will initially be linked
to other loci in its genetic background, even loci on other chromosomes.
If the allele increases in frequency in the population, initially it
will be paired with other alleles at that locus -- the new allele will
primarily be carried in individuals heterozygous for that locus.
The chance of it being paired with itself is low until it reaches
intermediate frequency. If the allele is recessive, its effect won't be
seen in any individual until a homozygote is formed. The
eventual fate of the allele depends on whether it is neutral,
deleterious or beneficial.


        <H5>Neutral alleles</H5>

<P>
Most neutral alleles are lost soon after they appear. The average
time (in generations) until loss of a neutral allele is 2(Ne/N) ln(2N)
where N is the effective population size (the number of individuals
contributing to the next generation's gene pool) and N is the total
population size. Only a small percentage of alleles fix. Fixation is
the process of an allele increasing to a frequency at or near one. The
probability of a neutral allele fixing in a population is equal to its
frequency. For a new mutant in a diploid population, this frequency
is 1/2N.

<P>
If mutations are neutral with respect to fitness, the rate of
substitution (k) is equal to the rate of mutation(v). This does not
mean every new mutant eventually reaches fixation. Alleles are
added to the gene pool by mutation at the same rate they are lost
to drift. For neutral alleles that do fix, it takes an average of 4N
generations to do so. However, at equilibrium there are multiple
alleles segregating in the population. In small populations, few
mutations appear each generation. The ones that fix do so quickly
relative to large populations. In large populations, more mutants
appear over the generations. But, the ones that fix take much
longer to do so. Thus, the rate of neutral evolution (in substitutions
per generation) is independent of population size.

<P>
The rate of mutation determines the level of heterozygosity at a
locus according to the neutral theory. Heterozygosity is simply the
proportion of the population that is heterozygous. Equilibrium
heterozygosity is given as H = 4Nv/[4Nv+1] (for diploid
populations). H can vary from a very small number to almost one.
In small populations, H is small (because the equation is
approximately a very small number divided by one). In (biologically
unrealistically) large populations, heterozygosity approaches one
(because the equation is approximately a large number divided by
itself). Directly testing this model is difficult because N and v
can only be estimated for most natural populations. But,
heterozygosities are believed to be too low to be described by
a strictly neutral model. Solutions offered by neutralists for
this discrepancy include hypothesizing that natural populations
may not be at equilibrium.

<P>
At equilibrium there should be a few alleles at intermediate
frequency and many at very low frequencies. This is the Ewens-
Watterson distribution. New alleles enter a population every
generation, most remain at low frequency until they are lost. A few
drift to intermediate frequencies, a very few drift all the way to
fixation. In <I>Drosophila pseudoobscura</I>, the protein Xanthine
dehydrogenase (Xdh) has many variants. In a single population,
Keith, et. al., found that 59 of 96 proteins were of one type, two
others were represented ten and nine times and nine other types
were present singly or in low numbers.

        <H5>Deleterious alleles</H5>

<P>
Deleterious mutants are selected against but remain at low frequency
in the gene pool. In diploids, a deleterious recessive mutant may
increase in frequency due to drift. Selection cannot see it when it
is masked by a dominant allele. Many disease causing alleles
remain at low frequency for this reason. People who are carriers
do not suffer the negative effect of the allele. Unless they mate
with another carrier, the allele may simply continue to be passed on.
Deleterious alleles also remain in populations at a low frequency due
to a balance between recurrent mutation and selection. This is called
the mutation load.


        <H5>Beneficial alleles</H5>

<P>
Most new mutants are lost, even beneficial ones. Wright calculated
that the probability of fixation of a beneficial allele is 2s. (This
assumes a large population size, a small fitness benefit, and that
heterozygotes have an intermediate fitness. A benefit of 2s yields
an overall rate of evolution: k=4Nvs where v is the mutation rate to
beneficial alleles) An allele that conferred a one percent increase in
fitness only has a two percent chance of fixing. The probability of
fixation of beneficial type of mutant is boosted by recurrent
mutation. The beneficial mutant may be lost several times, but
eventually it will arise and stick in a population. (Recall that even
deleterious mutants recur in a population.)

<P>
Directional selection depletes genetic variation at the selected locus
as the fitter allele sweeps to fixation. Sequences linked to the
selected allele also increase in frequency due to hitchhiking. The
lower the rate of recombination, the larger the window of sequence
that hitchhikes.  Begun and Aquadro compared the level of
nucleotide polymorphism within and between species with the rate
of recombination at a locus. Low levels of  nucleotide
polymorphism within species coincided with low rates of
recombination. This could be explained by molecular mechanisms if
recombination itself was mutagenic. In this case, recombination
with also be correlated with nucleotide divergence between
species. But, the level of sequence divergence did not correlate
with the rate of recombination. Thus, they inferred that
selection was the cause. The correlation between recombination
and nucleotide polymorphism leaves the conclusion that selective
sweeps occur often enough to leave an imprint on the level of
genetic variation in natural populations.

<P>
One example of a beneficial mutation comes from the mosquito
<I>Culex pipiens</I>. In this organism, a gene that was involved with
breaking down organophosphates - common insecticide ingredients
-became duplicated. Progeny of the organism with this mutation
quickly swept across the worldwide mosquito population. There
are numerous examples of insects developing resistance to
chemicals, especially DDT which was once heavily used in this
country. And, most importantly, even though "good" mutations
happen much less frequently than "bad" ones, organisms with
"good" mutations thrive while organisms with "bad" ones die out.

<P>
If beneficial mutants arise infrequently, the only fitness
differences in a population will be due to new deleterious mutants
and the deleterious recessives. Selection will simply be weeding
out unfit variants. Only occasionally will a beneficial allele be
sweeping through a population. The general lack of large fitness
differences segregating in natural populations argues that
beneficial mutants do indeed arise infrequently. However, the
impact of a beneficial mutant on the level of variation at a locus
can be large and lasting. It takes many generations for a locus
to regain appreciable levels of heterozygosity following a
selective sweep.

    <H3>Recombination </H3>

<P>
Each chromosome in our sperm or egg cells is a mixture of genes
from our mother and our father. Recombination can be thought of
as gene shuffling. Most organisms have linear chromosomes and
their genes lie at specific location (loci) along them. Bacteria have
circular chromosomes. In most sexually reproducing organisms,
there are two of each chromosome type in every cell. For instance
in humans, every chromosome is paired, one inherited from the
mother, the other inherited from the father. When an organism
produces gametes, the gametes end up with only one of each
chromosome per cell. Haploid gametes are produced from diploid
cells by a process called meiosis.

<P>
In meiosis, homologous chromosomes line up. The DNA of the
chromosome is broken on both chromosomes in several places and
rejoined with the other strand. Later, the two homologous
chromosomes are split into two separate cells that divide and
become gametes. But, because of recombination, both of the
chromosomes are a mix of alleles from the mother and father.

<P>
Recombination creates new combinations of alleles. Alleles that
arose at different times and different places can be brought
together. Recombination can occur not only between genes, but
within genes as well. Recombination within a gene can form a new
allele. Recombination is a mechanism of evolution because it adds
new alleles and combinations of alleles to the gene pool.


    <H3>Gene Flow</H3>

<P>
New organisms may enter a population by migration from another
population. If they mate within the population, they can bring new
alleles to the local gene pool. This is called gene flow. In some
closely related species, fertile hybrids can result from interspecific
matings. These hybrids can vector genes from species to species.

<P>
Gene flow between more distantly related species occurs
infrequently. This is called horizontal transfer. One interesting case
of this involves genetic elements called P elements. Margaret
Kidwell found that P elements were transferred from some species
in the <I>Drosophila willistoni</I> group to <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>.
These two species of fruit flies are distantly related and hybrids do
not form. Their ranges do, however, overlap. The P elements were
vectored into <I>D. melanogaster</I> via a parasitic mite that targets
both these species. This mite punctures the exoskeleton of the flies
and feeds on the "juices". Material, including DNA, from one fly can
be transferred to another when the mite feeds. Since P elements
actively move in the genome (they are themselves parasites of
DNA), one incorporated itself into the genome of a <I>melanogaster</I>
fly and subsequently spread through the species. Laboratory stocks
of <I>melanogaster</I> caught prior to the 1940's lack of P elements. All
natural populations today harbor them.

  <H2>Overview of Evolution within a Lineage</H2>

<P>
Evolution is a change in the gene pool of a population over time; it
can occur due to several factors. Three mechanisms add new alleles
to the gene pool: mutation, recombination and gene flow. Two
mechanisms remove alleles, genetic drift and natural selection.
Drift removes alleles randomly from the gene pool. Selection
removes deleterious alleles from the gene pool. The amount of
genetic variation found in a population is the balance between the
actions of these mechanisms.

<P>
Natural selection can also increase the frequency of an allele.
Selection that weeds out harmful alleles is called negative selection.
Selection that increases the frequency of helpful alleles is called
positive, or sometimes positive Darwinian, selection. A new allele
can also drift to high frequency. But, since the change in frequency
of an allele each generation is random, nobody speaks of positive
or negative drift.

<P>
Except in rare cases of high gene flow, new alleles enter the
gene pool as a single copy. Most new alleles added to the gene pool
are lost almost immediately due to drift or selection; only a small
percent ever reach a high frequency in the population. Even most
moderately beneficial alleles are lost due to drift when they
appear. But, a mutation can reappear numerous times.

<P>
The fate of any new allele depends a great deal on the organism it
appears in. This allele will be linked to the other alleles near it for
many generations. A mutant allele can increase in frequency
simply because it is linked to a beneficial allele at a nearby locus.
This can occur even if the mutant allele is deleterious, although it
must not be so deleterious as to offset the benefit of the other
allele. Likewise a potentially beneficial new allele can be
eliminated from the gene pool because it was linked to deleterious
alleles when it first arose. An allele "riding on the coat tails" of a
beneficial allele is called a hitchhiker. Eventually, recombination
will bring the two loci to linkage equilibrium. But, the more closely
linked two alleles are, the longer the hitchhiking will last.

<P>
The effects of selection and drift are coupled. Drift is intensified as
selection pressures increase. This is because increased selection (i.e.
a greater difference in reproductive success among organisms in a
population) reduces the effective population size, the number of
individuals contributing alleles to the next generation.

<P>
Adaptation is brought about by cumulative natural selection, the
repeated sifting of mutations by natural selection. Small changes,
favored by selection, can be the stepping-stone to further changes.
The summation of large numbers of these changes is
macroevolution.

<H1>The Development of Evolutionary Theory</H1>

<P>
Biology came of age as a science when Charles Darwin published
"On the Origin of Species."  But, the idea of evolution wasn't new to
Darwin. Lamarck published a theory of evolution in 1809. Lamarck
thought that species arose continually from nonliving sources.
These species were initially very primitive, but increased in
complexity over time due to some inherent tendency. This type of
evolution is called orthogenesis. Lamarck proposed that an
organism's acclimation to the environment could be passed on to its
offspring. For example, he thought proto-giraffes stretched their
necks to reach higher twigs. This caused their offspring to be born
with longer necks. This proposed mechanism of evolution is called
the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Lamarck also believed
species never went extinct, although they may change into newer
forms. All three of these ideas are now known to be wrong.

<P>
Darwin's contributions include hypothesizing the pattern of
common descent and proposing a mechanism for evolution --
natural selection. In Darwin's theory of natural selection, new
variants arise continually within populations. A small percentage of
these variants cause their bearers to produce more offspring than
others. These variants thrive and supplant their less productive
competitors. The effect of numerous instances of selection would
lead to a species being modified over time.

<P>
Darwin's theory did not accord with older theories of genetics. In
Darwin's time, biologists held to the theory of blending inheritance
-- an offspring was an average of its parents. If an individual had
one short parent and one tall parent, it would be of medium height.
And, the offspring would pass on genes for medium sized offspring.
If this was the case, new genetic variations would quickly be
diluted out of a population. They could not accumulate as the
theory of evolution required. We now know that the idea of
blending inheritance is wrong.

<P>
Darwin didn't know that the true mode of inheritance was discovered
in his lifetime. Gregor Mendel, in his experiments on hybrid peas,
showed that genes from a mother and father do not blend. An offspring
from a short and a tall parent may be medium sized; but it carries
genes for shortness and tallness. The genes remain distinct and can
be passed on to subsequent generations. Mendel mailed his paper to
Darwin, but Darwin never opened it.

<P>
It was a long time until Mendel's ideas were accepted. One group of
biologists, called biometricians, thought Mendel's laws only held for
a few traits. Most traits, they claimed, were governed by blending
inheritance. Mendel studied discrete traits. Two of the traits in his
famous experiments were smooth versus wrinkled coat on peas.
This trait did not vary continuously. In other words, peas are
either wrinkled or smooth -- intermediates are not found.
Biometricians considered these traits aberrations. They studied
continuously varying traits like size and believed most traits
showed blending inheritance.


<A NAME="genetics">
<H2>Incorporating Genetics into Evolutionary Theory</H2>
</A>

<P>
The discrete genes Mendel discovered would exist at some
frequency in natural populations. Biologists wondered how and if
these frequencies would change. Many thought that the more
common versions of genes would increase in frequency simply
because they were already at high frequency.

<P>
Hardy and Weinberg independently showed that the frequency of
an allele would not change over time simply due to its being rare
or common. Their model had several assumptions -- that all alleles
reproduced at the same rate, that the population size was very
large and that alleles did not change in form. Later, R. A. Fisher
showed that Mendel's laws could explain continuous traits if the
expression of these traits were due to the action of many genes.
After this, geneticists accepted Mendel's Laws as the basic rules of
genetics. From this basis, Fisher, Sewall Wright and J. B. S.. Haldane
founded the field of population genetics. Population genetics is a
field of biology that attempts to measure and explain the levels of
genetic variation in populations.

<P>
R. A. Fisher studied the effect of natural selection on large
populations. He demonstrated that even very small selective
differences amongst alleles could cause appreciable changes in
allele frequencies over time. He also showed that the rate of
adaptive change in a population is proportional to the amount of
genetic variation present. This is called Fisher's Fundamental
Theorem of Natural Selection. Although it is called the
fundamental theorem, it does not hold in all cases. The rate at
which natural selection brings about adaptation depends on the
details of how selection is working. In some rare cases, natural
selection can actually cause a decline in the mean relative fitness of
a population.

<P>
Sewall Wright was more concerned with drift. He stressed that
large populations are often subdivided into many subpopulations.
In his theory, genetic drift played a more important role compared
to selection. Differentiation between subpopulations, followed by
migration among them, could contribute to adaptations amongst
populations. Wright also came up with the idea of the adaptive
landscape -- an idea that remains influential to this day. Its
influence remains even though P. A. P. Moran has shown that,
mathematically, adaptive landscapes don't exist as Wright
envisioned them. Wright extended his results of one-locus
models to a two-locus case in proposing the adaptive landscape.
But, unbeknownst to him, the general conclusions of the one-locus
model don't extend to the two-locus case.

<P>
J. B. S. Haldane developed many of the mathematical models of
natural and artificial selection. He showed that selection and
mutation could oppose each other, that deleterious mutations could
remain in a population due to recurrent mutation. He also
demonstrated that there was a cost to natural selection,
placing a limit on the amount of adaptive substitutions a
population could undergo in a given time frame.

<P>
For a long time, population genetics developed as a theoretical
field. But, gathering the data needed to test the theories was nearly
impossible. Prior to the advent of molecular biology, estimates of
genetic variability could only be inferred from levels of
morphological differences in populations. Lewontin and Hubby
were the first to get a good estimate of genetic variation in a
population.  Using the then new technique of protein
electrophoresis, they showed that 30% of the loci in a population of
<I>Drosophila pseudoobscura</I> were polymorphic. They also showed
that it was likely that they could not detect all the variation that
was present. Upon finding this level of variation, the question became
-- was this maintained by natural selection, or simply the result of
genetic drift? This level of variation was too high to be explained
by balancing selection.

<P>
Motoo Kimura theorized that most variation found in populations
was selectively equivalent (neutral).  Multiple alleles at a locus
differed in sequence, but their fitnesses were the same. Kimura's
neutral theory described rates of evolution and levels of
polymorphism solely in terms of mutation and genetic drift. The
neutral theory did not deny that natural selection acted on natural
populations; but it claimed that the majority of natural variation
was transient polymorphisms of neutral alleles. Selection did not
act frequently or strongly enough to influence rates of evolution or
levels of polymorphism.

<P>
Initially, a wide variety of observations seemed to be consistent with
the neutral theory.  Eventually, however, several lines of evidence
toppled it. There is less variation in natural populations than
the neutral theory predicts. Also, there is too much variance in
rates of substitutions in different lineages to be explained by
mutation and drift alone. Finally, selection itself has been shown to
have an impact on levels of nucleotide variation. Currently, there is
no comprehensive mathematical theory of evolution that
accurately predicts rates of evolution and levels of heterozygosity
in natural populations.

<H1>Evolution Among Lineages</H1>

  <H2>The Pattern of Macroevolution</H2>

<P>
Evolution is not progress. The popular notion that evolution can be
represented as a series of improvements from simple cells, through
more complex life forms, to humans (the pinnacle of evolution), can
be traced to the concept of the scale of nature. This view is
incorrect.

<P>
All species have descended from a common ancestor. As time went
on, different lineages of organisms were modified with descent to
adapt to their environments. Thus, evolution is best viewed as a
branching tree or bush, with the tips of each branch representing
currently living species. No living organisms today are our
ancestors. Every living species is as fully modern as we are with its
own unique evolutionary history. No extant species are "lower life
forms," atavistic stepping stones paving the road to humanity.

<P>
A related, and common, fallacy about evolution is that humans
evolved from some living species of ape. This is not the case --
humans and apes share a common ancestor. Both humans and
living apes are fully modern species; the ancestor we evolved from
was an ape, but it is now extinct and was not the same as present
day apes (or humans for that matter). If it were not for the vanity
of human beings, we would be classified as an ape. Our closest
relatives are, collectively, the chimpanzee and the pygmy chimp.
Our next nearest relative is the gorilla.


<A NAME="ecd">
  <H2>Evidence for Common Descent and Macroevolution</H2>
</A>

<P>
Microevolution can be studied directly. Macroevolution cannot.
Macroevolution is studied by examining patterns in biological
populations and groups of related organisms and inferring process
from pattern. Given the observation of microevolution and the
knowledge that the earth is billions of years old -- macroevolution
could be postulated. But this extrapolation, in and of itself, does
not provide a compelling explanation of the patterns of biological
diversity we see today. Evidence for macroevolution, or common
ancestry and modification with descent, comes from several other
fields of study. These include: comparative biochemical and genetic
studies, comparative developmental biology, patterns of
biogeography, comparative morphology and anatomy and the fossil
record.

<P>
Closely related species (as determined by morphologists) have
similar gene sequences. Overall sequence similarity is not the
whole story, however. The pattern of differences we see in closely
related genomes is worth examining.

<P>
All living organisms use DNA as their genetic material, although
some viruses use RNA. DNA is composed of strings of nucleotides.
There are four different kinds of nucleotides: adenine (A), guanine
(G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T). Genes are sequences of nucleotides
that code for proteins. Within a gene, each block of three nucleotides
is called a codon. Each codon designates an amino acid (the subunits
of proteins).

<P>
The three letter code is the same for all organisms (with a few
exceptions). There are 64 codons, but only 20 amino acids to code
for; so, most amino acids are coded for by several codons. In many
cases the first two nucleotides in the codon designate the amino
acid. The third position can have any of the four nucleotides and
not effect how the code is translated.

<P>
A gene, when in use, is transcribed into RNA -- a nucleic acid
similar to DNA. (RNA, like DNA, is made up of nucleotides although t
he nucleotide uracil (U) is used in place of thymine (T).) The RNA
transcribed from a gene is called messenger RNA. Messenger RNA
is then translated via cellular machinery called ribosomes into
a string of amino acids -- a protein. Some proteins function as
enzymes, catalysts that speed the chemical reactions in cells.
Others are structural or involved in regulating development.

<P>
Gene sequences in closely related species are very similar. Often,
the same codon specifies a given amino acid in two related species,
even though alternate codons could serve functionally as well. But,
some differences do exist in gene sequences. Most often, differences
are in third codon positions, where changes in the DNA sequence would
not disrupt the sequence of the protein.

<P>
There are other sites in the genome where nucleotide differences do not
effect protein sequences. The genome of eukaryotes is loaded with 'dead
genes' called pseudogenes. Pseudogenes are copies of working genes
that have been inactivated by mutation. Most pseudogenes do not
produce full proteins. They may be transcribed, but not translated.
Or, they may be translated, but only a truncated protein is produced.
Pseudogenes evolve much faster than their working counterparts.
Mutations in them do not get incorporated into proteins, so they have
no effect on the fitness of an organism.

<P>
Introns are sequences of DNA that interrupt a gene, but do not code
for anything. The coding portions of a gene are called exons. Introns
are spliced out of the messenger RNA prior to translation, so they
do not contribute information needed to make the protein. They are
sometimes, however, involved in regulation of the gene. Like
pseudogenes, introns (in general) evolve faster than coding
portions of a gene.

<P>
Nucleotide positions that can be changed without changing the sequence
of a protein are called silent sites. Sites where changes result in
an amino acid substitution are called replacement sites. Silent sites
are expected to be more polymorphic within a population and show more
differences between populations. Although both silent and replacement
sites receive the same amount of mutations, natural selection only
infrequently allows changes at replacement sites. Silent sites,
however, are not as constrained.

<P>
Kreitman was the first demonstrate that silent sites were more
variable than coding sites. Shortly after the methods of DNA
sequencing were discovered, he sequenced 11 alleles of the enzyme
alcohol dehydrogenase (AdH). Of the 43 polymorphic nucleotide sites
he found, only one resulted in a change in the amino acid sequence
of the protein.

<P>
Silent sites may not be entirely selectively neutral. Some DNA
sequences are involved with regulation of genes, changes in these
sites may be deleterious. Likewise, although several codons code
for a single amino acid, an organism may have a preferred codon
for each amino acid. This is called codon bias.

<P>
If two species shared a recent common ancestor one would expect
genetic information, even information such as redundant
nucleotides and the position of introns or pseudogenes, to be
similar. Both species would have inherited this information from
their common ancestor.

<P>
The degree of similarity in nucleotide sequence is a function of
divergence time. If two populations had recently separated, few
differences would have built up between them. If they separated
long ago, each population would have evolved numerous differences
from their common ancestor (and each other). The degree of
similarity would also be a function of silent versus replacement
sites. Li and Graur, in their molecular evolution text, give the
rates of evolution for silent vs. replacement rates. The rates
were estimated from sequence comparisons of 30 genes from humans
and rodents, which diverged about 80 million years ago. Silent
sites evolved at an average rate of 4.61 nucleotide substitution
per 10<sup>9</sup> years. Replacement sites evolved much slower at an
average rate of 0.85 nucleotide substitutions per 10<sup>9</sup> years.

<P>
Groups of related organisms are 'variations on a theme' -- the same
set of bones are used to construct all vertebrates. The bones of the
human hand grow out of the same tissue as the bones of a bat's wing
or a whale's flipper; and, they share many identifying features such
as muscle insertion points and ridges. The only difference is that they
are scaled differently. Evolutionary biologists say this indicates
that all mammals are modified descendants of a common ancestor
which had the same set of bones.

<P>
Closely related organisms share similar developmental pathways.
The differences in development are most evident at the end. As
organisms evolve, their developmental pathway gets modified. An
alteration near the end of a developmental pathway is less likely to
be deleterious than changes in early development. Changes early
on may have a cascading effect. Thus most evolutionary changes in
development are expected to take place at the periphery of
development, or in early aspects of development that have no later
repercussions. For a change in early development to be propagated,
the benefit of the early alteration must outweigh the consequences
to later development.

<P>
Because they have evolved this way, organisms pass through the
early stages of development that their ancestors passed through up
to the point of divergence. So, an organism's development mimics
its ancestors although it doesn't recreate it exactly. Development of
the flatfish, Pleuronectes, illustrates this point. Early on,
Pleuronectes develops a tail that comes to a point. In the next
developmental stage, the top lobe of the tail is larger than the
bottom lobe (as in sharks). When development is complete, the
upper and lower lobes are equally sized. This developmental
pattern mirrors the evolutionary transitions it has undergone.

<P>
Natural selection can modify any stage of a life cycle, so some
differences are seen in early development. Thus, evolution does not
always recapitulate ancestral forms -- butterflies did not evolve
from ancestral caterpillars, for example. There are differences in
the appearance of early vertebrate embryos. Amphibians rapidly
form a ball of cells in early development. Birds, reptiles and
mammals form a disk. The shape of the early embryo is a result of
different yolk concentrations in the eggs. Birds' and reptiles' eggs
are heavily yolked. Their eggs develop similarly to amphibians
except the yolk has deformed the shape of the embryo. The ball is
stretched out and lying atop the yolk. Mammals have no yolk, but
still form a disk early. This is because they have descended from
reptiles. Mammals lost their yolky eggs, but retained the early
pattern of development. In all these vertebrates, the pattern of cell
movements is similar despite superficial differences in appearance.
In addition, all types quickly converge upon a primitive, fish-like
stage within a few days. From there, development diverges.

<P>
Traces of an organism's ancestry sometimes remain even when an
organism's development is complete. These are called vestigial
structures. Many snakes have rudimentary pelvic bones retained
from their walking ancestors. Vestigial does not mean useless,
it means the structure is clearly a vestige of an structure
inherited from ancestral organisms. Vestigial structures may
acquire new functions. In humans, the appendix now houses some
immune system cells.

<P>
Closely related organisms are usually found in close geographic
proximity; this is especially true of organisms with limited
dispersal opportunities. The mammalian fauna of Australia is often
cited as an example of this; marsupial mammals fill most of the
equivalent niches that placentals fill in other ecosystems. If all
organisms descended from a common ancestor, species distribution
across the planet would be a function of site of origination,
potential for dispersal, distribution of suitable habitat, and
time since origination. In the case of Australian mammals, their
physical separation from sources of placentals means potential
niches were filled by a marsupial radiation rather than a
placental radiation or invasion.

<P>
Natural selection can only mold available genetically based
variation. In addition, natural selection provides no mechanism for
advance planning. If selection can only tinker with the available
genetic variation, we should expect to see examples of jury-rigged
design in living species. This is indeed the case. In lizards of the
genus <I>Cnemodophorus</I>, females reproduce parthenogenetically.
Fertility in these lizards is increased when a female mounts
another female and simulates copulation. These lizards evolved from
sexual lizards whose hormones were aroused by sexual behavior. Now,
although the sexual mode of reproduction has been lost, the means
of getting aroused (and hence fertile) has been retained.

<P>
Fossils show hard structures of organisms less and less similar to
modern organisms in progressively older rocks. In addition, patterns
of biogeography apply to fossils as well as extant organisms. When
combined with plate tectonics, fossils provide evidence of distributions
and dispersals of ancient species. For example, South America had a
very distinct marsupial mammalian fauna until the land bridge formed
between North and South America. After that marsupials started
disappearing and placentals took their place. This is commonly
interpreted as the placentals wiping out the marsupials, but this
may be an over simplification.

<P>
Transitional fossils between groups have been found. One of the
most impressive transitional series is the ancient reptile to modern
mammal transition. Mammals and reptiles differ in skeletal details,
especially in their skulls. Reptilian jaws have four bones. The
foremost is called the dentary. In mammals, the dentary bone is
the only bone in the lower jaw. The other bones are part of the
middle ear. Reptiles have a weak jaw and a mouthful of
undifferentiated teeth. Their jaw is closed by three muscles: the
external, posterior and internal adductor. Each reptile tooth is
single cusped. Mammals have powerful jaws with differentiated
teeth. Many of these teeth, such as the molars, are multi-cusped.
The temporalis and masseter muscles, derived from the external
adductor, close the mammalian jaw. Mammals have a secondary
palate, a bony structure separating their nostril passages and
throat, so most can swallow and breathe simultaneously. Reptiles
lack this.

<P>
The evolution of these traits can be seen in a series of fossils.
<I>Procynosuchus</I> shows an increase in size of the dentary
bone and the beginnings of a palate. <I>Thrinaxodon</I> has a reduced
number of incisors, a precursor to tooth differentiation.
<I>Cynognathus</I> (a doglike carnivore) shows a further increase in
size of the dentary bone. The other three bones are located inside
the back portion of the jaw. Some teeth are multicusped and the
teeth fit together tightly. <I>Diademodon</I> (a plant eater) shows a
more advanced degree of occlusion (teeth fitting tightly).
<I>Probelesodon</I> has developed a double joint in the jaw. The jaw
could hinge off two points with the upper skull. The front hinge
was probably the actual hinge while the rear hinge was an
alignment guide. The forward movement of a hinge point allowed
for the precursor to the modern masseter muscle to anchor further
forward in the jaw. This allowed for a more powerful bite. The first
true mammal was <I>Morgonucudon</I>, a rodent-like insectivore from
the late Triassic. It had all the traits common to modern mammals.
These species were not from a single, unbranched lineage. Each is
an example from a group of organisms along the main line of
mammalian ancestry.

<P>
The strongest evidence for macroevolution comes from the fact
that suites of traits in biological entities fall into a nested pattern.
For example, plants can be divided into two broad categories, non-
vascular (ex. mosses) and vascular. Vascular plants can be divided
into seedless (ex. ferns) and seeded. Vascular seeded plants can be
divided into gymnosperms (ex. pines) and flowering plants (angiosperms).
Angiosperms can be divided into monocots and dicots. Each of these
types of plants have several characters that distinguish them
from other plants. Traits are not mixed and matched in groups
of organisms. For example, flowers are only seen in plants that
carry several other characters that distinguish them as
angiosperms. This is the expected pattern of common descent. All
the species in a group will share traits they inherited from their
common ancestor. But, each subgroup will have evolved unique traits
of its own. Similarities bind groups together. Differences show how
they are subdivided.

<P>
The real test of any scientific theory is its ability to generate
testable predictions and, of course, have the predictions borne out.
Evolution easily meets this criterion. In several of the above
examples I stated, closely related organisms share X. If I define
closely related as sharing X, this is an empty statement. It does
however, provide a prediction. If two organisms share a similar
anatomy, one would then predict that their gene sequences would
be more similar than a morphologically distinct organism. This has
been spectacularly borne out by the recent flood of gene sequences
-- the correspondence to trees drawn by morphological data is
very high. The discrepancies are never too great and usually
confined to cases where the pattern of relationship was debated.

  <H2>Mechanisms of Macroevolution</H2>

<P>
The following deals with mechanisms of evolution above the
species level.

    <H3>Speciation -- Increasing Biological Diversity </H3>

<P>
Speciation is the process of a single species becoming two or more
species. Many biologists think speciation is key to understanding
evolution. Some would argue that certain evolutionary phenomena apply
only at speciation and macroevolutionary change cannot occur without
speciation. Other biologists think major evolutionary change can
occur without speciation. Changes between lineages are only an
extension of the changes within each lineage. In general,
paleontologists fall into the former category and geneticists in the
latter.


      <H4>Modes of Speciation</H4>

<P>
Biologists recognize two types of speciation: allopatric and
sympatric speciation. The two differ in geographical distribution of
the populations in question. Allopatric speciation is thought to be
the most common form of speciation. It occurs when a population is
split into two (or more) geographically isolated subdivisions that
organisms cannot bridge. Eventually, the two populations' gene
pools change independently until they could not interbreed even if
they were brought back together. In other words, they have
speciated.

<P>
Sympatric speciation occurs when two subpopulations become
reproductively isolated without first becoming geographically
isolated. Insects that live on a single host plant provide a model for
sympatric speciation. If a group of insects switched host plants
they would not breed with other members of their species still
living on their former host plant. The two subpopulations could
diverge and speciate. Agricultural records show that a strain of the
apple maggot fly <I>Rhagolettis pomenella</I> began infesting apples in
the 1860's. Formerly it had only infested hawthorn fruit. Feder,
Chilcote and Bush have shown that two races of <I>Rhagolettis
pomenella</I> have become behaviorally isolated. Allele frequencies
at six loci (aconitase 2, malic enzyme, mannose phosphate
isomerase, aspartate amino-transferase, NADH-diaphorase-2, and
beta-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase) are diverging. Significant
amounts of linkage disequilibrium have been found at these loci,
indicating that they may all be hitchhiking on some allele under
selection. Some biologists call sympatric speciation microallopatric
speciation to emphasize that the subpopulations are still physically
separate at an ecological level.

<P>
Biologists know little about the genetic mechanisms of speciation.
Some think a series of small changes in each subdivision gradually
lead to speciation. The founder effect could set the stage for
relatively rapid speciation, a genetic revolution in Ernst Mayr's
terms. Alan Templeton hypothesized that a few key genes
could change and confer reproductive isolation. He called this a
genetic transilience. Lynn Margulis thinks most speciation events
are caused by changes in internal symbionts. Populations of
organisms are very complicated. It is likely that there are many
ways speciation can occur. Thus, all of the above ideas may be
correct, each in different circumstances. Darwin's book was titled
"The Origin of Species" despite the fact that he did not really
address this question; over one hundred and fifty years later, how
species originate is still largely a mystery.

      <H4>Observed Speciations</H4>

<P>
Speciation has been observed. In the plant genus <I>Tragopogon</I>, two
new species have evolved within the past 50-60 years. They are <I>T.
mirus</I> and <I>T. miscellus</I>. The new species were formed when one
diploid species fertilized a different diploid species and produced
a tetraploid offspring. This tetraploid offspring could not fertilize
or be fertilized by either of its two parent species types. It is
reproductively isolated, the definition of a species.

    <H3>Extinction -- Decreasing Biological Diversity</H3>

      <H4>Ordinary Extinction</H4>

<P>
Extinction is the ultimate fate of all species. The reasons for
extinction are numerous. A species can be competitively excluded
by a closely related species, the habitat a species lives in can
disappear and/or the organisms that the species exploits could
come up with an unbeatable defense.

<P>
Some species enjoy a long tenure on the planet while others are
short- lived. Some biologists believe species are programmed to
go extinct in a manner analogous to organisms being destined to
die. The majority, however, believe that if the environment stays
fairly constant, a well adapted species could continue to survive
indefinitely.

      <H4>Mass Extinction</H4>

<P>
Mass extinctions shape the overall pattern of macroevolution. If
you view evolution as a branching tree, it's best to picture it as one
that has been severely pruned a few times in its life. The history of
life on this earth includes many episodes of mass extinction in
which many groups of organisms were wiped off the face of the
planet. Mass extinctions are followed by periods of radiation where
new species evolve to fill the empty niches left behind. It is
probable that surviving a mass extinction is largely a function of
luck. Thus, contingency plays a large role in patterns of
macroevolution.

<P>
The largest mass extinction came at the end of the Permian, about
250 million years ago. This coincides with the formation of Pangaea
II, when all the world's continents were brought together by plate
tectonics. A worldwide drop in sea level also occurred at this time.

<P>
The most well-known extinction occurred at the boundary between
the Cretaceous and Tertiary Periods. This called the K/T Boundary
and is dated at around 65 million years ago. This extinction
eradicated the dinosaurs. The K/T event was probably caused by
environmental disruption brought on by a large impact of an
asteroid with the earth. Following this extinction the mammalian
radiation occurred. Mammals coexisted for a long time with the
dinosaurs but were confined mostly to nocturnal insectivore niches.
With the eradication of the dinosaurs, mammals radiated to fill the
vacant niches.

<P>
Currently, human alteration of the ecosphere is causing a global
mass extinction.

<A NAME="punkeek">
    <H3>Punctuated Equilibrium</H3>
</A>

<P>
The theory of punctuated equilibrium is an inference about the
process of macroevolution from the pattern of species documented
in the fossil record. In the fossil record, transition from one species
to another is usually abrupt in most geographic locales -- no
transitional forms are found. In short, it appears that species
remain unchanged for long stretches of time and then are quickly
replaced by new species. However, if wide ranges are searched,
transitional forms that bridge the gap between the two species are
sometimes found in small, localized areas. For example, in Jurassic
brachiopods of the genus <I>Kutchithyris</I>, <I>K. acutiplicata</I> appears
below another species, <I>K. euryptycha</I>. Both species were common
and covered a wide geographical area. They differ enough that
some have argued they should be in a different genera. In just one
small locality an approximately 1.25m sedimentary layer with
these fossils is found. In the narrow (10 cm) layer that separates
the two species, both species are found along with transitional
forms. In other localities there is a sharp transition.

<P>
Eldredge and Gould proposed that most major morphological change
occurs (relatively) quickly in small peripheral population at
the time of speciation. New forms will then invade the range of
their ancestral species. Thus, at most locations that fossils are
found, transition from one species to another will be abrupt. This
abrupt change will reflect replacement by migration however, not
evolution. In order to find the transitional fossils, the area of
speciation must be found.

<P>
There has been considerable confusion about the theory. Some
popular accounts give the impression that abrupt changes in the
fossil record are due to blindingly fast evolution; this is not a part
of the theory.

<P>
Punctuated equilibrium has been presented as a hierarchical
theory of evolution. Proponents of punctuated equilibrium see
speciation as analogous to mutation and the replacement of one
species by another as analogous to natural selection. This is called
species selection. Speciation adds new species to the species pool
just as mutation adds new alleles to the gene pool. Species selection
favors one species over another just as natural selection can favor
one allele over another. Evolutionary trends within a group would be
the result of selection among species, not natural selection acting
within species. This is the most controversial part of the theory.
Many biologists agree with the pattern of macroevolution these
paleontologists posit, but believe species selection is not even
theoretically likely to occur.

<P>
Critics would argue that species selection is not analogous to natural
selection and therefore evolution is not hierarchical. Also, the number
of species produced over time is far less than the amount of different
alleles that enter gene pools over time. So, the amount of adaptive
evolution produced by species selection (if it did occur) would have
to be orders of magnitude less than adaptive evolution within
populations by natural selection.

<P>
Tests of punctuated equilibrium have been equivocal. It has been
known for a long time that rates of evolution vary over time, that
is not controversial. However, phylogenetic studies conflict as to
whether there is a clear association between speciation and
morphological change. In addition, there are major polymorphisms
within some species. For example, bluegill sunfish have two male
morphs. One is a large, long-lived, mate-protecting male; the
other is a smaller, shorter-lived male who sneaks matings from
females guarded by large males. The existence of within species
polymorphisms demonstrates that speciation is not a requirement
for major morphological change.

<A NAME="history">
<H1>A Brief History of Life</H1>
</A>

<P>
Biologists studying evolution do a variety of things: population
geneticists study the process as it is occurring; systematists seek to
determine relationships between species and paleontologists seek
to uncover details of the unfolding of life in the past. Discerning
these details is often difficult, but hypotheses can be made and
tested as new evidence comes to light. This section should be
viewed as the best hypothesis scientists have as to the history of the
planet. The material here ranges from some issues that are fairly
certain to some topics that are nothing more than informed
speculation. For some points there are opposing hypotheses -- I
have tried to compile a consensus picture. In general, the more
remote the time, the more likely the story is incomplete or in error.

<P>
Life evolved in the sea. It stayed there for the majority of the
history of earth.

<P>
The first replicating molecules were most likely RNA. RNA is a
nucleic acid similar to DNA. In laboratory studies it has been shown
that some RNA sequences have catalytic capabilities. Most
importantly, certain RNA sequences act as polymerases -- enzymes
that form strands of RNA from its monomers. This process of self
replication is the crucial step in the formation of life. This is called
the RNA world hypothesis.

<P>
The common ancestor of all life probably used RNA as its genetic
material. This ancestor gave rise to three major lineages of life.
These are: the prokaryotes ("ordinary" bacteria), archaebacteria
(thermophilic, methanogenic and halophilic bacteria) and
eukaryotes. Eukaryotes include protists (single celled organisms
like amoebas and diatoms and a few multicellular forms such as
kelp), fungi (including mushrooms and yeast), plants and animals.
Eukaryotes and archaebacteria are the two most closely related of
the three. The process of translation (making protein from the
instructions on a messenger RNA template) is similar in these
lineages, but the organization of the genome and transcription
(making messenger RNA from a DNA template) is very different in
prokaryotes than in eukaryotes and archaebacteria. Scientists
interpret this to mean that the common ancestor was RNA based; it
gave rise to two lineages that independently formed a DNA genome
and hence independently evolved mechanisms to transcribe DNA
into RNA.

<P>
The first cells must have been anaerobic because there was no
oxygen in the atmosphere. In addition, they were probably
thermophilic ("heat-loving") and fermentative. Rocks as old as 3.5
billion years old have yielded prokaryotic fossils. Specifically, some
rocks from Australia called the Warrawoona series give evidence of
bacterial communities organized into structures called
stromatolites. Fossils like these have subsequently been found all
over the world. These mats of bacteria still form today in a few
locales (for example, Shark Bay Australia). Bacteria are the only life
forms found in the rocks for a long, long time --eukaryotes (protists)
appear about 1.5 billion years ago and fungi-like things appear
about 900 million years ago (0.9 billion years ago).

<P>
Photosynthesis evolved around 3.4 billion years ago.
Photosynthesis is a process that allows organisms to harness
sunlight to manufacture sugar from simpler precursors. The first
photosystem to evolve, PSI, uses light to convert carbon dioxide
(CO2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to glucose. This process releases
sulfur as a waste product. About a billion years later, a second
photosystem (PS) evolved, probably from a duplication of the first
photosystem. Organisms with PSII use both photosystems in
conjunction to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into
glucose. This process releases oxygen as a waste product.
Anoxygenic (or H2S) photosynthesis, using PSI, is seen in living
purple and green bacteria. Oxygenic (or H2O) photosynthesis, using
PSI and PSII, takes place in cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria are
closely related to and hence probably evolved from purple
bacterial ancestors. Green bacteria are an outgroup. Since oxygenic
bacteria are a lineage within a cluster of anoxygenic lineages,
scientists infer that PSI evolved first. This also corroborates with
geological evidence.

<P>
Green plants and algae also use both photosystems. In these
organisms, photosynthesis occurs in organelles (membrane bound
structures within the cell) called chloroplasts. These organelles
originated as free living bacteria related to the cyanobacteria that
were engulfed by ur-eukaryotes and eventually entered into an
endosymbiotic relationship. This endosymbiotic theory of
eukaryotic organelles was championed by Lynn Margulis.
Originally controversial, this theory is now accepted. One key line
of evidence in support of this idea came when the DNA inside
chloroplasts was sequenced -- the gene sequences were more
similar to free-living cyanobacteria sequences than to sequences
from the plants the chloroplasts resided in.

<P>
After the advent of photosystem II, oxygen levels increased.
Dissolved oxygen in the oceans increased as well as atmospheric
oxygen. This is sometimes called the oxygen holocaust. Oxygen is a
very good electron acceptor and can be very damaging to living
organisms. Many bacteria are anaerobic and die almost
immediately in the presence of oxygen. Other organisms, like
animals, have special ways to avoid cellular damage due to this
element (and in fact require it to live.) Initially, when oxygen
began building up in the environment, it was neutralized by
materials already present. Iron, which existed in high
concentrations in the sea was oxidized and precipitated. Evidence
of this can be seen in banded iron formations from this time, layers
of iron deposited on the sea floor. As one geologist put it, "the
world rusted." Eventually, it grew to high enough concentrations to
be dangerous to living things. In response, many species went
extinct, some continued (and still continue) to thrive in anaerobic
microenvironments and several lineages independently evolved
oxygen respiration.

<P>
The purple bacteria evolved oxygen respiration by reversing the
flow of molecules through their carbon fixing pathways and
modifying their electron transport chains. Purple bacteria also
enabled the eukaryotic lineage to become aerobic. Eukaryotic cells
have membrane bound organelles called mitochondria that take
care of respiration for the cell. These are endosymbionts like
chloroplasts. Mitochondria formed this symbiotic relationship
very early in eukaryotic history, all but a few groups of eukaryotic
cells have mitochondria. Later, a few lineages picked up
chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have multiple origins. Red algae picked
up ur-chloroplasts from the cyanobacterial lineage. Green algae, the
group plants evolved from, picked up different urchloroplasts from
a prochlorophyte, a lineage closely related to cyanobacteria.

<P>
Animals start appearing prior to the Cambrian, about 600 million
years ago. The first animals dating from just before the Cambrian
were found in rocks near Adelaide, Australia. They are called the
Ediacarian fauna and have subsequently been found in other
locales as well. It is unclear if these forms have any surviving
descendants. Some look a bit like Cnidarians (jellyfish, sea
anemones and the like); others resemble annelids (earthworms).
All the phyla (the second highest taxonomic category) of animals
appeared around the Cambrian. The Cambrian 'explosion' may have
been a result of higher oxygen concentrations enabling larger
organisms with higher metabolisms to evolve. Or it might be due to
the spreading of shallow seas at that time providing a variety of
new niches. In any case, the radiation produced a wide variety of
animals.

<P>
Some paleontologists think more animal phyla were present then
than now. The animals of the Burgess shale are an example of
Cambrian animal fossils. These fossils, from Canada, show a bizarre
array of creatures, some which appear to have unique body plans
unlike those seen in any living animals.

<P>
The extent of the Cambrian explosion is often overstated. Although
quick, the Cambrian explosion is not instantaneous in geologic time.
Also, there is evidence of animal life prior to the Cambrian. In
addition, although all the phyla of animals came into being, these
were <I>not</I> the modern forms we see today. Our own phylum
(which we share with other mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians
and fish) was represented by a small, sliver-like thing called
<I>Pikaia</I>.  Plants were not yet present. Photosynthetic protists and
algae were the bottom of the food chain. Following the Cambrian,
the number of marine families leveled off at a little less than 200.

<P>
The Ordovician explosion, around 500 million years ago, followed.
This 'explosion', larger than the Cambrian, introduced numerous
families of the Paleozoic fauna (including crinoids,
articulate brachiopods, cephalopods and corals). The Cambrian
fauna, (trilobites, inarticulate brachiopods, etc.) declined slowly
during this time. By the end of the Ordovician, the Cambrian fauna
had mostly given way to the Paleozoic fauna and the number of
marine families was just over 400. It stayed at this level until the
end of the Permian period.

<P>
Plants evolved from ancient green algae over 400 million years
ago. Both groups use chlorophyll a and b as photosynthetic
pigments. In addition, plants and green algae are the only groups
to store starch in their chloroplasts. Plants and fungi (in symbiosis)
invaded the land  about 400 million years ago. The first plants
were moss-like and required moist environments to survive. Later,
evolutionary developments such as a waxy cuticle allowed some
plants to exploit more inland environments. Still mosses lack true
vascular tissue to transport fluids and nutrients. This limits their
size since these must diffuse through the plant. Vascular plants
evolved from mosses. The first vascular land plant known is
<I>Cooksonia</I>, a spiky, branching, leafless structure. At the same
time, or shortly thereafter, arthropods followed plants onto the
land. The first land animals known are myriapods -- centipedes
and millipedes.

<P>
Vertebrates moved onto the land by the Devonian period, about
380 million years ago. <I>Ichthyostega</I>, an amphibian, is the among
the first known land vertebrates. It was found in Greenland and
was derived from lobe-finned fishes called Rhipidistians.
Amphibians gave rise to reptiles. Reptiles had evolved scales to
decrease water loss and a shelled egg permitting young to be
hatched on land. Among the earliest well preserved reptiles
is <I>Hylonomus</I>, from rocks in Nova Scotia.

<P>
The Permian extinction was the largest extinction in history. It
happened about 250 million years ago. The last of the Cambrian
Fauna went extinct. The Paleozoic fauna took a nose dive from
about 300 families to about 50. It is estimated that 96% of all
species (50% of all Families) met their end. Following this event,
the Modern fauna, which had been slowly expanding since the
Ordovician, took over.

<P>
The Modern fauna includes fish, bivalves, gastropods and crabs.
These were barely affected by the Permian extinction. The Modern
fauna subsequently increased to over 600 marine families at
present. The Paleozoic fauna held steady at about 100 families. A
second extinction event shortly following the Permian kept animal
diversity low for awhile.

<P>
During the Carboniferous (the period just prior to the Permian) and
in the Permian the landscape was dominated by ferns and their
relatives. After the Permian extinction, gymnosperms (ex. pines)
became more abundant. Gymnosperms had evolved seeds, from
seedless fern ancestors, which helped their ability to disperse.
Gymnosperms also evolved pollen, encased sperm which allowed
for more outcrossing.

<P>
Dinosaurs evolved from archosaur reptiles, their closest living
relatives are crocodiles. One modification that may have been a key
to their success was the evolution of an upright stance. Amphibians
and reptiles have a splayed stance and walk with an undulating
pattern because their limbs are modified from fins. Their gait is
modified from the swimming movement of fish. Splay stanced
animals cannot sustain continued locomotion because they cannot
breathe while they move; their undulating movement compresses
their chest cavity. Thus, they must stop every few steps and breath
before continuing on their way. Dinosaurs evolved an upright
stance similar to the upright stance mammals independently
evolved. This allowed for continual locomotion. In addition,
dinosaurs evolved to be warm-blooded. Warmbloodedness allows
an increase in the vigor of movements in erect organisms. Splay
stanced organisms would probably not benefit from warm-
bloodedness. Birds evolved from sauriscian dinosaurs.
Cladistically, birds are dinosaurs. The transitional fossil
<I>Archaeopteryx</I> has a mixture of reptilian and avian features.

<P>
Angiosperms evolved from gymnosperms, their closest relatives
are Gnetae. Two key adaptations allowed them to displace
gymnosperms as the dominant fauna -- fruits and flowers. Fruits
(modified plant ovaries) allow for animal-based seed dispersal and
deposition with plenty of fertilizer. Flowers evolved to facilitate
animal, especially insect, based pollen dispersal. Petals are
modified leaves. Angiosperms currently dominate the flora of the
world -- over three fourths of all living plants are angiosperms.

<P>
Insects evolved from primitive segmented arthropods. The mouth parts of
insects are modified legs. Insects are closely related to annelids.
Insects dominate the fauna of the world. Over half of all named
species are insects. One third of this number are beetles.

<P>
The end of the Cretaceous, about 65 million years ago, is marked by
a minor mass extinction.  This extinction marked the demise of all
the lineages of dinosaurs save the birds.  Up to this point mammals
were confined to nocturnal, insectivorous niches. Once the
dinosaurs were out of the picture, they diversified.
<I>Morgonucudon</I> , a contemporary of dinosaurs, is an example of
one of the first mammals. Mammals evolved from therapsid
reptiles. The finback reptile <I>Diametrodon</I> is an example of a
therapsid. One of the most successful lineages of mammals is, of
course, humans. Humans are neotenous apes. Neoteny is a process
which leads to an organism reaching reproductive capacity in its
juvenile form. The primary line of evidence for this is the
similarities between young apes and adult humans. Louis Bolk
compiled a list of 25 features shared between adult humans and
juvenile apes, including facial morphology, high relative brain
weight, absence of brow ridges and cranial crests.

<P>
The earth has been in a state of flux for 4 billion years. Across this
time, the abundance of different lineages varies wildly. New
lineages evolve and radiate out across the face of the planet,
pushing older lineages to extinction, or relictual existence in
protected refugia or suitable microhabitats. Organisms modify
their environments.  This can be disastrous, as in the case of the
oxygen holocaust.  However, environmental modification can be
the impetus for further evolutionary change. Overall, diversity has
increased since the beginning of life. This increase is, however,
interrupted numerous times by mass extinctions. Diversity appears
to have hit an all-time high just prior to the appearance of humans.
As the human population has increased, biological diversity has
decreased at an ever-increasing pace. The correlation is probably
causal.

<H1>Scientific Standing of Evolution and its Critics</H1>

<P>
The theory of evolution and common descent were once controversial
in scientific circles. This is no longer the case. Debates
continue about how various aspects of evolution work.  For
example, all the details of patterns of relationships are not fully
worked out. However, evolution and common descent are
considered fact by the scientific community.

<P>
Scientific creationism is 100% crap. So-called "scientific"
creationists do not base their objections on scientific reasoning or
data. Their ideas are based on religious dogma, and their approach is
simply to attack evolution. The types of arguments they use fall into
several categories: distortions of scientific principles ( <A
HREF="/faqs/thermo.html">the second law of thermodynamics
argument</A>), straw man versions of evolution (<A
HREF="/faqs/faq-misconceptions.html#chance">the "too improbable to
evolve by chance" argument</A>), dishonest selective use of data (<A
HREF="/faqs/c-decay.html">the declining speed of light argument</A>)
appeals to emotion or wishful thinking ("I don't want to be related to
an ape"), appeals to personal incredulity ("I don't see how this could
have evolved"), dishonestly quoting scientists out of context (<A
HREF="/faqs/ce/3/part8.html">Darwin's comments on the evolution of
the eye</A>) and simply fabricating data to suit their arguments (<A
HREF="/faqs/cre-error.html">Gish's "bullfrog proteins"</A>).

<P>
Most importantly, scientific creationists do not have a testable,
scientific theory to replace evolution with. Even if evolution turned
out to be wrong, it would simply be replaced by another scientific
theory. Creationists do not conduct scientific experiments, nor do
they seek publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Much
of their output is "preaching to the choir."

<P>
The most persuasive creationist argument is a non-scientific
one -- the appeal to fair play. "Shouldn't we present both sides of
the argument?," they ask. The answer is no -- the fair thing to do
is exclude scientific creationism from public school science
courses. Scientists have studied and tested evolution for 150
years. There is voluminous evidence for it. Within the scientific
community, there are no competing theories. Until scientific
creationists formulate a scientific theory, and submit it for
testing, they have no right to demand equal time in science class
to present their ideas. Evolution has earned a place in the science
curriculum. Creationism has not.

<P>
Science is based on an open and honest look at the data. Much of
creationism is built on dishonest debating techniques and special
pleading for a case the data does not support. Science belongs in
science classes. Evolution is science. Creationism is not. It's that
simple.

<P>
The creationist attack on public school education means that school
children are denied the possibility of learning about the most
powerful and elegant theory in biology. Politicians are willing to
allow the scientifically ignorant, but politically strong, to wreck the
educational system in exchange for votes. People interested in
evolution, and science education in general, need to closely watch
school board elections. Creationist "stealth" candidates have been
elected in several regions. Thankfully, many have been voted out
once their views became apparent.

<P>
The majority of Americans are religious, but only a minority are
religious nuts. The version of religion the far right wants to impose
on America is as repulsive to most mainstream Christians as it is to
members of other religions, atheists and agnostics. Most informed
religious people see no reason for biological facts and theories
to interfere with their religious beliefs.

<H1>The Importance of Evolution in Biology</H1>

<P>
"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution." --
Theodosius Dobzhansky

<P>
Evolution has been called the cornerstone of biology, and for good
reasons. It is possible to do research in biology with little or no
knowledge of evolution. Most biologists do. But, without evolution
biology becomes a disparate set of fields. Evolutionary explanations
pervade all fields in biology and brings them together under one
theoretical umbrella.

<P>
We know from microevolutionary theory that natural selection
should optimize the existing genetic variation in a population to
maximize reproductive success. This provides a framework for
interpreting a variety of biological traits and their relative
importance. For example, a signal intended to attract a mate could
be intercepted by predators. Natural selection has caused a trade-
off between attracting mates and getting preyed upon. If you assume
something other than reproductive success is optimized, many things
in biology would make little sense. Without the theory of evolution,
life history strategies would be poorly understood.

<P>
Macroevolutionary theory also helps explain many things about
how living things work. Organisms are modified over time by
cumulative natural selection.  The numerous examples of jury-
rigged design in nature are a direct result of this. The distribution
of genetically based traits across groups is explained by splitting of
lineages and the continued production of new traits by mutation.
The traits are restricted to the lineages they arise in.

<P>
Details of the past also hold explanatory power in biology. Plants
obtain their carbon by joining carbon dioxide gas to an organic
molecule within their cells. This is called carbon fixation. The
enzyme that fixes carbon is RuBP carboxlyase. Plants using C3
photosynthesis lose 1/3 to 1/2 of the carbon dioxide they
originally fix. RuBP carboxlyase works well in the absence of
oxygen, but poorly in its presence. This is because photosynthesis
evolved when there was little gaseous oxygen present. Later, when
oxygen became more abundant, the efficiency of photosynthesis
decreased. Photosynthetic organisms compensated by making more
of the enzyme. RuBP carboxylase is the most abundant protein on
the planet partially because it is one of the least efficient.

<P>
Ecosystems, species, organisms and their genes all have long
histories. A complete explanation of any biological trait must have
two components. First, a proximal explanation -- how does it work?
And second, an ultimate explanation -- what was it modified from?
For centuries humans have asked, "Why are we here?" The answer
to that question lies outside the realm of science. Biologists,
however,  can provide an elegant answer to the question, "How did
we get here?"
