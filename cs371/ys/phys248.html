	<dd><p>The scientific study of light. Physical optics is concerned
with the creation, nature, and properties of light. Psychological optics
pertains to the role of light in vision. Geometrical optics deals with the
properties of <i>reflection</i> and <i>refraction</i> of light, as part of
the study of mirrors, lenses, and optical fibers.</p></dd>

<p>As you can see from the dictionary definition above, the study of
optics falls into three general categories: light itself, what it is and
how it behaves; How we perceive light through the sense of sight; and how
light can be manipulated through such processes as reflection and
refraction.  Although we talk of these categories as if they were separate
and distinct, actually the whole reality of sight and vision constantly
involves all of these categories in various combinations.</p>

<p>For example, consider a rainbow. This visual phenomenon not only
involves both reflection and refraction, but also is a practical
demonstration that different colors of light refract differently, even
under fixed circumstances.
<!--
 For an excellent discussion of rainbows and
their characteristics, take a look at <a

<p>This set of pages is still under construction. As each discussion is
completed, the appropriate links in the list below will be activated. The
topics to be discussed (subject to change if needed) are:</p>

<ol>

	<li><a href="what_is_light.html">The Nature of Light</a>. Here
we explore the basic structure and behavior of light. Is light a wave or a
particle?<sub>&nbsp;</sub></li>

	<li><a href="reflrefr1.html">Reflection and Refraction</a>.
These are two basic methods by which we can affect and control the
behavior of light.<sub>&nbsp;</sub></li>

	<li>Colors and Filtering. White light is actually a mixture of
all possible colors. Do different colors have slightly different
properties?<sub>&nbsp;</sub></li>

	<li><a href = "lens_intro.html">Lenses</a>. How and why do lenses
work to concentrate and focus light?<sub>&nbsp;</sub></li>

	<li>Lasers. How can we generate light in such a way that it is all
at the same wavelength and all traveling in the same
direction?<sub>&nbsp;</sub></li>

	<li><a href="fiber1.html">Fiber Optics</a>. How can a transparent
thread of glass or plastic manage to hold light within itself and transmit
it from one end to the other, even around corners?<sub>&nbsp;</sub></li>

	<li>Rainbows.  
One of the prettiest sights involving light and color, the rainbow is a
special example of an optical phenomenon that has intrigued people
throughout the ages.<sub>&nbsp;</sub></li>
