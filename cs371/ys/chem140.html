    <td width="90%"><p>It would be impossible to visit or live in Indonesia and not be exposed 
        to one of the country's most highly developed art forms, batik. On your 
        first visit to a batik store or factory you will undoubtedly experience 
        an overwhelming stimulation of the senses - due to the many colors, patterns 
        and the actual smell of batik. Only through repeated visits and a bit of 
        study will the types of designs and their origins become apparent.</p>
      <p>The 
        word batik is thought to be derived from the word '<em>ambatik' </em>which 
        translated means 'a cloth with little dots'. The suffix '<em>tik' </em>means 
        little dot, drop, point or to make dots. Batik may also originate from 
        the Javanese word '<em>tritik' </em>which describes a resist process for 
        dying where the patterns are reserved on the textiles by tying and sewing 
        areas prior to dying, similar to tie dye techniques. Another Javanese 
        phase for the mystical experience of making batik is &#8220;<em>mbatik 
        manah</em>&#8221; which means &#8220;drawing a batik design on the heart&#8221;.</p>
      <h2>A Brief History</h2>
      <p>Although experts disagree as to the precise origins of batik, samples 
        of dye resistance patterns on cloth can be traced back 1,500 years ago 
        to Egypt and the Middle East. Samples have also been found in Turkey, 
        India, China, Japan and West Africa from past centuries. Although in these 
        countries people were using the technique of dye resisting decoration, 
        within the textile realm, none have developed batik to its present day 
        art form as the highly developed intricate batik found on the island of 
        Java in Indonesia.</p>
      <p><img src="/images/statue.jpg" alt="King Kertajasa East Java 1294-1309" width="162" height="300" class="fll" />Although 
        there is mention of 'fabrics highly decorated' in Dutch transcripts from 
        the 17th century, most scholars believe that the intricate Javanese batik 
        designs would only have been possible after the importation of finely 
        woven imported cloth, which was first imported to Indonesia from India 
        around the 1800s and afterwards from Europe beginning in 1815. Textile 
        patterns can be seen on stone statues that are carved on the walls of 
        ancient Javanese temples such as Prambanan (AD 800), however there is 
        no conclusive evidence that the cloth is batik. It could possibly be a 
        pattern that was produced with weaving techniques and not dying. What is clear is that in the 19th century batik became highly developed 
        and was well ingrained in Javanese cultural life.</p>
      <p>Some experts feel that batik was originally reserved as an art form 
        for Javanese royalty. Certainly it's royal nature was clear as certain 
        patterns were reserved to be worn only by royalty from the Sultan's palace. 
        Princesses and noble women may have provided the inspiration for the highly 
        refined design sense evident in traditional patterns. It is highly unlikely 
        though that they would be involved in any more than the first wax application. 
        Most likely, the messy work of dyeing and subsequent waxings was left 
        to court artisans who would work under their supervision.</p>
      <p>Javanese royalty were known to be great patrons of the arts and provided 
        the support necessary to develop many art forms, such as silver ornamentation, <em>wayang kulit</em> (leather puppets) and <em>gamelan </em>orchestras. In 
        some cases the art forms overlap. The Javanese <em>dalang </em>(puppeteer) 
        not only was responsible for the wayang puppets but was also <img src="/images/tambalmiringdesign.jpg" alt="Tambil Miring Design" width="200" height="200" class="flr" />an 
        important source of batik patterns. Wayang puppets are usually made of 
        goat skin, which is then perforated and painted to create the illusion 
        of clothing on the puppet. Used puppets were often sold to eager ladies 
        who used the puppets as guides for their batik patterns. They would blow 
        charcoal through the holes that define the patterns of clothing on the 
        puppets, in order to copy the intricate designs onto the cloth.</p>
      <p>Other scholars disagree that batik was only reserved as an art form 
        for royalty, as they also feel its use was prevalent with the <em>rakyat</em>, 
        the people. It was regarded an important part of a young ladies accomplishment 
        that she be capable of handling a <em>canting </em>(the pen-like instrument 
        used to apply wax to the cloth) with a reasonable amount of skill, certainly 
        as important as cookery and other housewifery arts to Central Javanese 
        women.</p>
      <h2>Selection and Preparation of the Cloth for Batik</h2>
      <p>Natural materials such as cotton or silk are used for the cloth, so 
        that it can absorb the wax that is applied in the dye resisting process. 
        The fabrics must be of a high thread count (densely woven). It is important 
        that cloth of high quality have this high thread count so that the intricate 
        design qualities of batik can be maintained.</p>
      <p><img src="/images/olderladyapplywax.jpg" alt="Applying wax with a canting to create Batik" width="163" height="200" class="fll" />The 
        cloth that is used for batik is washed and boiled in water many times 
        prior to the application of wax so that all traces of starches, lime, 
        chalk and other sizing materials are removed. Prior to the implementation 
        of modern day techniques, the cloth would have been pounded with a wooden 
        mallet or ironed to make it smooth and supple so it could best receive 
        the wax design. With the finer machine-made cotton available today, the 
        pounding or ironing processes can be omitted. Normally men did this step 
        in the batik process.</p>
      <p>Strict industry standards differentiate the different qualities of 
        the cloth used today, which include Primissima (the best) and Prima. The 
        cloth quality is often written on the edge of the design. A lesser quality 
        cloth which is often used in Blaco.</p>
      <h2>Batik Design Tools</h2>
      <p>Although the art form of batik is very intricate, the tools that are 
        used are still very simple. The <em>canting</em>, believed to be a purely 
        Javanese invention, is a small thin wall spouted copper container (sometimes 
        called a wax pen) that is connected to a short bamboo handle. Normally 
        it is approximately 11 cm. in length. The copper container is filled with 
        melted wax and the artisan then uses the <em>canting </em>to draw the design 
        on the cloth.</p>
      <p><em>Canting </em>have different sizes of spouts (numbered to correspond 
        to the size) to achieve varied design effects. The spout can vary from 
        1 mm in diameter for very fine detailed work to wider spouts used to fill 
        in large design areas. Dots and parallel lines may be drawn with <em>canting </em>that have up to 9 spouts. Sometimes a wad of cotton is fastened over 
        the mouth of the <em>canting </em>or attached to a stick that acts as a 
        brush to fill in very large areas.</p>
      <p>For <a href="cantingbatiktool.html">close-up pictures of canting</a>.</p>
      <h3><em>Wajan</em></h3>
      <p><img src="/images/wajan1.jpg" alt="Wajan is used to melt the wax" width="170" height="163" class="flr" />The <em>wajan </em>is the container that holds the melted wax. It looks like 
        a small wok. Normally it is made of iron or earthenware. The <em>wajan </em>is placed on a small brick charcoal stove or a spirit burner called 
        an '<em>anglo'</em>. The wax is kept in a melted state while the artisan 
        is applying the wax to the cloth.</p>
      <h2>Wax</h2>
      <p>Different kinds and qualities of wax are used in batik. Common waxes 
        used for batik consist of a mixture of beeswax, used for its malleability, 
        and paraffin, used for its friability. Resins can be added to increase 
        adhesiveness and animal fats create greater liquidity.</p>
      <p><img src="/images/blowingcanting.jpg" alt="Blowing into the Canting keeps the wax flowing freely" width="169" height="144" class="fll" />The 
        best waxes are from the Indonesian islands of Timor, Sumbawa and Sumatra; 
        three types of petroleum-based paraffin (white, yellow and black) are 
        used. The amounts mixed are measured in grams and vary according to the 
        design. Wax recipes can be very closely guarded secrets. Varying colors 
        of wax make it possible to disguise different parts of the pattern through 
        the various dying stages. Larger areas of the pattern are filled in with 
        wax that is cheaper quality and the higher quality wax is used on the 
        more intricately detailed sections of the design.</p>
      <p>The wax must be kept at the proper temperature. A wax that is too 
        cool will clog the spout of the canting. A wax that is too hot will flow 
        too quickly and be uncontrollable. The artisan will often blow into the 
        spout of the canting before applying wax to the cloth in order to clear 
        the canting of any obstructions.</p>
      <h3><em>Cap</em></h3>
      <p><img src="/images/cop.jpg" alt="Cap utilize copper string to make various designs" width="225" height="135" class="flr" />Creating 
        batik is a very time consuming craft. To meet growing demands and make 
        the fabric more affordable to the masses, in the mid-19th century the <em>. cap. (</em>copper stamp - pronounced chop) was developed. This invention 
        enabled a higher volume of batik production compared to the traditional 
        method which entailed the tedious application of wax by hand with a <em>canting</em>.</p>
      <p>Each <em>cap </em>is a copper block that makes up a design unit. <em>Cap </em>are made of 1.5 cm wide copper stripes that are bent into the shape 
        of the design. Smaller pieces of wire are used for the dots. When complete, 
        the pattern of copper strips is attached to the handle.</p>
      <p>The <em>cap </em>must be precisely made. This is especially true if 
        the pattern is to be stamped on both sides of the fabric. It is imperative 
        that both sides of the <em>cap </em>are identical so that pattern will be 
        consistent.</p>
      <p>Sometimes <em>cap </em>are welded between two grids like pieces of copper 
        that will make a base for the top and the<img src="/images/capprocess.jpg" alt="Applying wax with cap" width="151" height="200" class="fll" /> bottom. The block is cut in half at the center so the pattern on each 
        half is identical. <em>Cap</em> vary in size and shape depending on the 
        pattern they are needed for. It is seldom that a <em>cap </em>will exceed 
        24 cm in diameter, as this would make the handling too difficult.</p>
      <p>Men usually handle the application of wax using <em>cap</em>. A piece 
        of cloth that involves a complicated design could require as many as ten 
        sets of <em>cap</em>. The usage of <em>cap</em>, as opposed to canting, to 
        apply the wax has reduced the amount of time to make a cloth.</p>
      <p>Today, batik quality is defined by <em>cap </em>or <em>tulis</em>, the 
        second meaning hand-drawn designs which use a <em>canting, </em>or <em>kombinasi</em>, 
        a combination of the two techniques.</p>
      <h3>Dyes</h3>
      <p>Traditional colors for Central Javanese batik were made from natural 
        ingredients and consisted primarily of beige, blue, brown and black.</p>
      <p>The oldest color that was used in traditional batik making was blue. 
        The color was made from the leaves of the Indigo plant. The leaves were 
        mixed with molasses sugar and lime and left to stand overnight. Sometimes 
        sap from the Tinggi tree was added to act as a fixing agent. Lighter blue 
        was achieved by leaving the cloth in the dye bath for short periods of 
        time. For darker colors, the cloth would be left in the dye bath for days 
        and may have been submerged up to 8 - 10 times a day.</p>
      <p>In traditional batik, the second color applied was a brown color called <em>soga</em>. The color could range from light yellow to a dark brown. 
        The dye came from the bark of the Soga tree. Another color that was traditionally 
        used was a dark red color called <em>mengkuda</em>. This dye was created 
        from the leaves of the <em>Morinda Citrifolia</em>.</p>
      <p>The final hue depended on how long the cloth was soaked in the dye 
        bath and how often it was dipped. Skilled artisans can create many variations 
        of these traditional colors. Aside from blue, green would be achieved 
        by mixing blue with yellow; purple was obtained by mixing blue and red. 
        The <em>soga </em>brown color mixed with indigo would produce a dark blue-black 
        color.</p>
      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <p>The outline of the pattern is blocked out onto the cloth, traditionally 
        with charcoal or graphite. Traditional batik designs utilize patterns 
        handed down over the generations. It is very seldom that an artisan is 
        so skilled that he can work from memory and would not need to draw an 
        outline of the pattern before applying the wax. Often designs are traced 
        from stencils or patterns called <em>pola</em>. Another method of tracing 
        a pattern onto a cloth is by laying the cloth on a glass table that is 
        illuminated from below which casts a shadow of the pattern onto the cloth. 
        The shadow is then traced with a pencil. In large batik factories today, 
        men usually are in charge of drawing the patterns onto the cloth. <a href="batiksteps.html">Click 
        here to see the step-by-step process of making batik.</a></p>
      <h3>Waxing</h3>
      <p>Once the design is drawn out onto the cloth it is then ready to be 
        waxed. Wax is applied to the cloth over the areas <img src="/images/applyingwax.jpg" alt="Applying wax with a Canting" width="192" height="282" class="flr" />of 
        the design that the artisan wishes to remain the original color of the 
        cloth. Normally this is white or cream.</p>
      <p>Female workers sit on a low stool or on a mat to apply the wax with 
        a canting. The fabric that they are working on is draped over light bamboo 
        frames called <em>gawangan </em>to allow the freshly applied wax to cool 
        and harden. The wax is heated in the <em>wajan </em>until it is of the desired 
        consistency. The artisan then dips her canting into the wax to fill the 
        bowl of the <em>canting</em>.</p>
      <p>Artisans use the wax to retrace the pencil outline on the fabric. 
        A small drop cloth is kept on the woman. s lap to protect her from hot 
        dripping wax. The stem of the <em>canting</em> is held with the right hand 
        in a horizontal position to prevent any accidental spillage, which greatly 
        reduces the value of the final cloth. The left hand is placed behind the 
        fabric for support. The spout does not touch the fabric, but it held just 
        above the area the artisan is working on. To ensure the pattern is well 
        defined, batik is waxed on both sides. True <em>tulis </em>batik is reversible, 
        as the pattern should be identical on both sides.</p>
      <p>The most experienced artisans normally do first waxings. Filling in 
        of large areas may be entrusted to less experienced artisans. Mistakes 
        are very difficult to correct. If wax is accidentally spilt on the cloth, 
        the artisan will try to remove the unwanted wax by sponging it with hot 
        water. Then a heated iron rod with a curved end is used to try and lift 
        off the remaining wax. Spilled wax can never be completely removed so 
        it is imperative that the artisans are very careful.</p>
      <p><img src="/images/manymenwithcop.jpg" alt="Applying wax with a copper cap" width="185" height="210" class="fll" />If 
        the cap method is utilized, this procedure is normally done by men. The <em>cap </em>are dipped into melted wax. Just under the surface of the melted 
        wax is a folded cloth approximately 30 centimeters square. When this cloth 
        is saturated with wax it acts like a stamp pad. The <em>cap </em>is pressed 
        into the fabric until the design side of the cap is coated with wax. The 
        saturated <em>cap </em>is then stamped onto the fabric, leaving the design 
        of the <em>cap</em>. This process is repeated until the entire cloth is 
        covered. Often <em>cap </em>and <em>canting </em>methods are combined on the 
        same piece of cloth.</p>
      <p>Better quality batik may be waxed utilizing canting in one part of 
        Indonesia and then sent to another part of Indonesia where the <em>cap </em>part of the process is completed. On better quality <em>cap </em>fabric 
        great care is taken to match the pattern exactly. Lower grade batik is 
        characterized by overlapping lines or lightened colored lines indicating 
        the <em>cap </em>was not applied correctly.</p>
      <h2>Dyeing</h2>
      <p>After the initial wax has been applied, the fabric is ready for the 
        first dye bath. Traditionally dying was done in earthenware tubs. Today 
        most batik factories use large concrete vats. Above the vats are ropes 
        with pulleys that the fabric is draped over after it has been dipped into 
        the dye bath.</p>
      <p>The waxed fabric is immersed in the dye bath of the first color. The 
        amount of time it is left in the bath determines the hue of the color; 
        darker colors require longer periods or numerous immersions. The fabric 
        is then put into a cold water bath to harden the wax.</p>
      <p><img src="/images/dyebath.jpg" alt="Dye Bath" width="236" height="231" class="flr" />When 
        the desired color has been achieved and the fabric has dried, wax is reapplied 
        over the areas that the artisan wishes to maintain the first dye color 
        or another color at a later stage in the dying process.</p>
      <p>When an area that has been covered with wax previously needs to be 
        exposed so that it can be dyed, the applied wax is scraped away with a 
        small knife. The area is then sponged with hot water and resized with 
        rice starch before it is re-immersed in the subsequent dye bath.</p>
      <p>If a marble effect is desired, the wax is intentionally cracked before 
        being placed in the dye bath. The dye seeps into the tiny cracks that 
        create the fine lines that are characteristic of batik. Traditionally, 
        cracks were a sign of inferior cloth especially on indigo color batik. 
        On brown batik, however, the marble effect was accepted.</p>
      <p>The number of colors in batik represents how many times it was immersed 
        in the dye bath and how many times wax had to be applied and removed. 
        A multicolored batik represents a lot more work that a single or two-color 
        piece. Numerous dye processes are usually reflected in the price of the 
        cloth. Nowadays, chemical dyes have pretty much replaced traditional dyes, 
        so colors are endless and much more liberally used.</p>
      <h2 align="center">Special Treatments to the Batik Cloth</h2>
      <h3><em>Prada </em>or Gold Cloth</h3>
      <p>For special occasions, batik was formerly decorated with gold lead 
        or gold dust. This cloth is known as Prada cloth. Gold leaf was used in 
        the Jogjakarta and Surakarta area. The Central Javanese used gold dust 
        to decorate their Prada cloth. It was applied to the fabric using a handmade 
        glue consisting of egg white or linseed oil and yellow earth. The gold 
        would remain on the cloth even after it had been washed. The gold could 
        follow the design of the cloth or could take on its own design. Older 
        batiks could be given a new look by applying gold to them. Gold decorated 
        cloth is still made today; however, gold paint has replaced gold dust 
        and leaf.</p>
      <h2><a href="batikdesigns.html">Batik Designs</a></h2>
      <p>Although there are thousands of different batik designs, particular 
        designs have traditionally been associated with traditional festivals 
        and specific religious ceremonies. Previously, it was thought that certain 
        cloth had mystical powers to ward off ill fortune, while other pieces 
        could bring good luck.</p>
      <img src="/images/weddingdesign.jpg" alt="Wedding Batik" width="200" height="200" class="flr" />
      <p>Certain batik designs are reserved for brides and bridegrooms as well 
        as their families. Other designs are reserved for the Sultan and his family 
        or their attendants. A person's rank could be determined by the pattern 
        of the batik he/she wore.</p>
      <p>In general, there are two categories of batik design: geometric motifs 
        (which tend to be the earlier designs) and free form designs, which are 
        based on stylized patterns of natural forms or imitations of a woven texture. <em>Nitik </em>is the most famous design illustrating this effect.</p>
      <p>Certain areas are known for a predominance of certain designs. Central 
        Javanese designs are influenced by traditional patterns and colors. Batik 
        from the north coast of Java, near Pekalongan and Cirebon, have been greatly 
        influenced by Chinese culture and effect brighter colors and more intricate 
        flower and cloud designs.</p>
      <p>High fashion designs drawn on silk are very popular with wealthy Indonesians. 
        These exceptionally high-quality pieces can take months to create and 
        costs hundreds of dollars.</p>
      <h3><em>Kawung</em></h3>
      <p><img src="/images/kawang.jpg" alt="Kawung Design" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" class="flr" /><em>Kawung </em>is another very old design consisting of intersecting circles, known 
        in Java since at least the thirteenth century. This design has appeared 
        carved into the walls of many temples throughout Java such as Prambanan 
        near Jogjakarta and Kediri in East Java. For many years, this pattern 
        was reserved for the royal court of the Sultan of Jogjakarta. The circles 
        are sometimes embellished inside with two or more small crosses or other 
        ornaments such as intersecting lines or dots. It has been suggested that 
        the ovals might represent flora such as the fruit of the <em>kapok </em>(silk 
        cotton) tree or the <em>aren (</em>sugar palm).</p>
      <h3><em>Ceplok</em></h3>
      <p><img src="/images/ceplok.jpg" alt="Ceplok Design" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" class="flr" /><em>Ceplok </em>is a general name for a whole series of geometric designs based on 
        squares, rhombs, circles, stars, etc. Although fundamentally geometric, 
        ceplok can also represent abstractions and stylization of <a href="floristsinindonesia.html#Culture">flowers</a>, buds, 
        seeds and even animals. Variations in color intensity can create illusions 
        of depth and the overall effect is not unlike medallion patterns seen 
        on Turkish tribal rugs. The Indonesian population is largely Muslim, a 
        religion that forbids the portrayal of animal and human forms in a realistic 
        manner. To get around this prohibition, the batik worker does not attempt 
        to express this matter in a realistic form. A single element of the form 
        is chosen and then that element is repeated again and again in the pattern.</p>
      <h3><em>Parang</em></h3>
      <p><img src="/images/parang.jpg" alt="Parang Design" width="200" height="200" class="flr" /><em>Parang </em>was once used exclusively by the royal courts of Central Java. It 
        has several suggested meanings such as 'rugged rock', 'knife pattern' 
        or 'broken blade'. The Parang design consists of slanting rows of thick 
        knife-like segments running in parallel diagonal bands. Parang usually 
        alternated with narrower bands in a darker contrasting color. These darker 
        bands contain another design element, a line of lozenge-shaped motifs 
        call mlinjon. There are many variations of this basic striped pattern 
        with its elegant sweeping lines, with over forty parang designs recorded. 
        The most famous is the '<em>Parang Rusak' </em>which in its most classical 
        form consisting of rows of softly folded parang. This motif also appears 
        in media other than batik, including woodcarving and as ornamentation 
        on gamelan musical instruments.</p>
      <h2>Washing Batik</h2>
      <p>Harsh chemical detergents, dryers and drying of fabrics in the sun 
        may fade the colors in batik. Traditionally dyed batiks should be washed 
        in soap for sensitive fabrics, such as Woolite, Silky or Halus. Fine batik 
        in Indonesia is washed with the <em>lerak </em>fruit which can be purchased 
        at most traditional markets. A bottled version of this detergent is also 
        available at batik stores. Be sure to line dry batik in a shady area and 
        not in direct sunlight.</p>
      <h2 align="center">Modern Batik</h2>
      <p>Modern batik, although having strong ties to traditional batik, utilizes 
        linear treatment of leaves, flowers and birds. These batiks tend to be 
        more dependent on the dictates of the designer rather than the stiff guidelines 
        that have guided traditional craftsmen. This is also apparent in the use 
        of color that modern designers use. Artisans are no <img src="/images/modern.jpg" alt="Modern Batik" width="200" height="200" class="fll" />longer 
        dependent on traditional (natural) dyes, as chemical dyes can produce 
        any color that they wish to achieve. Modern batik still utilizes canting 
        and cap to create intricate designs.</p>
      <p>Fashion designers such as Iwan Tirta have aggressively introduced 
        batik into the world fashion scene. They have done much to promote the 
        Indonesian art of batik dress, in its traditional and modern forms.</p>
      <p>The horizon of batik is continuing to widen. While the design process 
        has remained basically the same over the last century, the process shows 
        great progress in recent decades. Traditionally, batik was sold in 2 1/4 
        meter lengths used for <em>kain panjang </em>or <em>sarong </em>in traditional 
        dress. Now, not only is batik used as a material to clothe the human body, 
        its uses also include furnishing fabrics, heavy canvas wall hangings, 
        tablecloths and household accessories. Batik techniques are used by famous 
        artists to create batik paintings which grace many homes and offices.</p>
      <p>Fine quality handmade batik is very expensive and the production of 
        such works is very limited. However, in a <img src="/images/tyedye.jpg" alt="Modern Batik" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" class="flr" />world 
        that is dominated by machines there is an increasing interest in materials 
        that have been handmade. Batik is one of these materials.</p>
