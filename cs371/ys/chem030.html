<p><li> <img src="http://www.nbc-links.com/graphics/new.gif" alt="new" width="31" height="12"> I've finally settled down and will have more time to dedicate to the site.  More stuff to follow!  

<p><li> <img src="http://www.nbc-links.com/graphics/new.gif" alt="new" width="31" height="12"> I've just updated all of the NBC links on this site!  Given the capabilities of today's search engines, large pages of links are now an anachronism.  (I started NBC-Links.com in 1993 on GeoCities.com to learn HTML and to have an online reference of my favorite NBC links. Search engines back in the day left much to be desired.)  The links will continue to be available in the future but may be eliminated in the future. 

<p><li><a href="http://www.nbc-links.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.cgi"> NBC Links' CBRN Discussion Board </a> Current forums include: General CBRNE Discussion Board, Request for Information (RFI) Forum, CBRNE Officer/NCO Forum, Employment Opportunities (Help Wanted/Situation Wanted) forum, and Feedback Board.  

<p><li><a href="http://www.nbc-links.com/repository/"> Repository of NBC Defense-related Products </a> The repository contains a wealth of NBC-related information.  The information is geared towards CBRN defense personnel at division-level and below� where the rubber meets the road.  It consists of training documents, spreadsheets, presentations, etc. The material is posted in a password-protected directory.  I�ve limited access to individuals with military e-mail addresses (.mil extension). 

<p><li><a href="http://www.nbc-links.com/library.html"> NBC Links' CBRN Library. </a> Listing of personal references.

<p><li><a href="humor.html">Military Humor Pages </a> If you can't laugh at yourself, I will...  PowerPoint, Military Planners, etc.
<br><p>

<p><li><a href="misc.html">Miscellaneous Links </a> A collection of entertaining and informative links that are not necessarily CBRN-related.  
<br><p>

<p><li> <a href="http://www.nbc-links.com/dui.html"> Chemical Unit Distinctive Insignia </a> Many thanks to the American Society of Military Insignia Collectors (ASMIC) for permission to publish parts of their catalog.  

<p><li> <a href="http://www.nbc-links.com/ssi.html"> Chemical Unit Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (SSI) </a> Look for a chemical unit challenge coins page in the future.  

<p><li><h4>Wanted: Chemical Unit Paraphernalia </h4> I am always looking to acquire chemical unit paraphernalia such as unit coins, distinctive unit insignias/crests, patches, etc. I am especially interested in all 2d Chemical Battalion items to include ephemera.  Please let me know if you have any items that you would like to sell, trade, etc.

While the United States officially found that toxin weapons had been used in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan, questions regarding use, agent composition and responsibility still remain. The Yellow Rain case study focuses attention on some of the difficulties that can arise during an investigation, including problems in obtaining good data, the challenges in confirming use and reaching an attribution determination in the absence of such data, and the consequences that flow from these difficulties.

Ketchum.  Chemical warfare watchers, from scientists to policy advocates, often wonder what went on at the Army Chemical Center during the 1960s.  It was a decade in which thousands of Army enlisted men served as volunteers for the secret testing of chemical agents. The actual historical record, however, has until now remained disturbingly incomplete.�� This book goes a long way toward revealing the contents of once classified documents that still reside in restricted archives. 
<br>
The author spent most of a decade testing over a dozen potential incapacitating agents including LSD, BZ and marijuana derivatives.� His 380-page narrative, loaded with both old and recent photographs, derives from technical reports, memoranda, films, notes and memories.� The book is written primarily for the general reader, but supplemented by a voluminous appendix of graphs and tables for the technically inclined, Dr. Ketchum�s book combines a subjective diary with an objective report of the external events that shaped and eventually terminated the program.� Informal and autobiographical in style, it includes numerous amusing anecdotes and personality portraits that make it simultaneously intriguing and informative.�

AFOAT/1 [later renamed the Air Force Technical Applications Center, or AFTAC] soon had an early triumph--the discovery of the first Soviet atomic test in 1949. For many years, AFOAT-1/AFTAC operated under the veil of secrecy; in 1949 no one without a high security clearance and only those with a clear "need to know" were aware that it was AFOAT-1 that had detected the Soviet test. It was not until 1975 that the Air Force even admitted that AFTAC had responsibility for operating the AEDS.

The report includes a user's manual for TERET, as well as a PowerPoint slide introduction to chemical, biological, and radiological threat agents designed as an executive-level communications tool based on summary information from the report.

In 511 days of combat, the 2nd Chemical Mortar Battalion cleared the way for eighteen divisions in seven campaigns and three invasions. Here for the first time is the story of this combat-tested unit, told in the pictures and memories of the veterans themselves with the son of a mortar company commander as their voice.  Look for a book on the 2d Chemical Mortar Battalion's Korean War history in 2006.
