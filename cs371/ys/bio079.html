        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1">Quantitative real time PCR
        is an important step for the validation of expression data generated
        by microarray analysis and other genomics techniques. This has
        been facilitated by the development of real time PCR instruments
        that measure the amount of PCR product produced at each step
        of the reaction or in &quot;real time&quot;. Examples of these
        include the Roche LightCycler and the Perkin Elmer ABI 7700 Sequence
        Detection System. These machines support a variety of chemistries
        for template detection including SYBR green dye intercalation
        as well as hybridization probes, hydrolysis probes and molecular
        beacons. SYBR green is currently the most popular real time PCR
        method due to its relative ease and reliability. Primers sets
        may be designed using standard primer design algorithms without
        any modification. As with all PCR amplifications, however, the
        specific reaction conditions for each set must be optimized,
        particularly primer concentration, annealing temperature and
        magnesium chloride concentration. However, many primer sets fail
        to amplify the desired template despite all attempts to optimize
        the reaction conditions and a new set of primers must be designed
        and synthesized. Considering the time and cost of designing and
        optimizing primer sets along with the relatively large number
        of candidate genes that are identified by microarray studies,
        the development of a central repository for primer sets, reaction
        conditions and even the actual oligonucleotides would benefit
        all investigators involved in genomics and other types of experiments.
        Therefore, we would like to use this site to serve the needs
        of researchers who are interested in both contributing to and
        taking advantage of information about quantitative real time
        PCR.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1">Quantitative real time PCR
        has revolutionized our ability to measure nucleic acid concentrations.
        Prior to the development of real time PCR technology, quantitative
        measurements required one to set up multiple PCR reactions in
        order to capture PCR product at a linear phase of amplification.
        Separation and quantitation of the PCR products was then done
        by gel electrophoresis or HPLC. These experiments are quite laborious
        and the number of manipulations required to achieve proper quantitation
        increased the likelihood of introducing error. Thus, the development
        of real time PCR instruments that could measure PCR product at
        each thermocycle enhanced the ease, accuracy and reproducibility
        of quantitative PCR. A variety of applications have emerged as
        a result of the discovery of real time PCR. These include 1)
        validation of gene expression data obtained by </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"><A

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1">In general, real time PCR
        protocols are similar to that of standard PCR reactions. The
        same issues apply with respect to producing clean template, designing
        primers and optimizing reaction conditions. The major difference
        is the incorporation of an intercalating agent such as SYBR green
        or the use fluorescent primers for the detection of PCR product.
        A description of the different real time PCR chemistries is provided
        by clicking the specific method at the top of this page. In a
        typical reaction, PCR product is produced exponentially. Because
        it takes several cycles for enough product to be readily detectable,
        the plot of fluorescence vs. cycle number exhibits a sigmoidal
        appearance. At later cycles, the reaction substrates become depleted,
        PCR product no longer doubles, and the curve begins to flatten.
        The point on the curve in which the amount of fluorescence begins
        to increase rapidly, usually a few standard deviations above
        the baseline, is termed the threshold cycle (Ct value). The plot
        of Ct versus template is linear, thus a comparison of Ct values
        between multiple reactions enables one to calculate the concentration
        of the target nucleic acid. The slope of this line provides a
        measure of PCR efficiency. Some real time PCR instruments enable
        users to generate melting curves following the completion of
        PCR. Melting curves provide an indication of the purity of the
        reaction product and reveal the presence of primer dimers.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1">PCR products may be quantitated
        by generating a standard curve or quantitated relative to a control
        gene. Real time PCR quantitation based on a standard curve may
        utilize plasmid DNA or other forms of DNA in which the absolute
        concentration of each standard is known. One must be sure, however,
        that the efficiency of PCR is the same for the standards as that
        of the &quot;unknown&quot; samples. Performing PCR from purified
        targets can in some cases be more efficient than that observed
        with complex nucleic acid mixtures. The relative quantitation
        method is somewhat simpler as it requires the measurement of
        housekeeper or control genes to normalize expression of the target
        gene. However, the selection of appropriate control genes can
        cause problems as they may not necessarily be equally expressed
        across all unknown samples. This may be circumvented by normalizing
        measurements to a set of housekeeping genes in order to avoid
        this variability problem.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1">A critical aspect of performing
        real time PCR is to begin with a template that is of high purity.
        This can be challenging when working with some biological samples.
        Fortunately, a number of commercial products have been developed
        to facilitate the isolation of nucleic acids in high purity.
        Removing contaminating phenol and unwanted DNA are steps to consider.
        For gene expression studies, reverse transcription must be carried
        out with high purity reagents and in multiple replicates as this
        step can introduce variability in template replication. Reverse
        transcription may be done prior to real time PCR or may be incorporated
        within the amplification program.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
