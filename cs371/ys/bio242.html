<CENTER><H1>The Clovis First / Pre-Clovis Problem</H1>
<H4>by Tony Baker<BR>November 5, 1997</H4> <H3><a HREF=" http://www.ele.net/art_folsom/pre-clovis_2004/preclovis2004.htm"><font color="Red">To read my 2004 Opinions, Click here</font></A></H3></Center>


<P>The Clovis First / Pre-Clovis subject is controversial and because of
that I have delayed writing my opinions on the subject.  However, the
creation of the WEB page <A HREF="art_fols.htm"> "Art and the Folsom
Point"</A> caused me to go public on the subject. I could have easily
omitted one paragraph in that page and then I could have delayed this
page, again. However, I chose not to because I did not embark on creating
WEB pages with the intention of "walking on eggs" when it comes to
difficult subjects. 

<P>The ideas presented herein have been changing over the years and will
probably continue to change.  They are founded on logic and not the
several purported pre-Clovis sites around the continent.  They are the
result of handling material from around the World and many conversations
with <A HREF="http://www.primtech.net">Dr. Bruce Bradley</A>.  Which
concepts are his, which are mine, which we concocted together or with
which ones he does not agree, I can no longer determine. I just know the
ideas presented here would have been different without the discussions
with Bruce. <Strong><I>(Since I first wrote this, Bruce has offered his
comments on the subject (12/17/97) and I have included links to them.

<P>I have divided the WEB page into two sections.  In the first I will
develop the necessary background by discussing various aspects of blades,
Clovis point manufacture, the Middle and Upper Paleolithic, and the
Solutrean tradition found in Western Europe.  In the second section I will
propose my theory and discuss the necessary implications.<HR>

<H3><CENTER>Background</CENTER></H3>

<P>A blade is generally defined as a flake that is twice as long as it is
wide.  In my opinion, this definition leads to confusion among
archaeologists.  There is a difference between a flake removed from a
ridge of an amorphous core that results in a flake as described above, and
a flake removed from a core prepared in such a manner as to produce many
similar flakes with the above geometry.  The difference is the intent of
the knapper and this intent defines the two basic lithic technologies used
by modern man.  These are the blade and the flake (or non-blade) 
technologies.  I define a BLADE as a flake made by a BLADE technology and
not by its geometry.  (To eliminate future confusion, I will use the word
blade to mean a single flake that is twice as long as it is wide but not
necessarily from a blade technology.  I will use the word BLADE, written
in capitals, to mean a BLADE from a BLADE technology.)

<P>The archaeologist can recognize the difference between a BLADE 
technology and a flake technology by viewing the entire assemblage.  An
assemblage from a BLADE technology will consist of mostly (maybe 70% or
higher) BLADES or tools made on BLADES, plus BLADE cores and exhausted
BLADE cores.  An assemblage from a flake technology will consist of few or
no blades and the complete absence of BLADE cores.  Therefore, by my
definition, an occasional flake that is twice as long as it is wide found
in an assemblage does not make that assemblage the result of a BLADE 
technology. 

<P>The Upper Paleolithic in Europe and Asia was a BLADE technology. The
bright line distinction between the Middle and Upper Paleolithic was the
change from a flake to a BLADE technology.  At 11,500 B.P., the time
Clovis appeared in the New World, the people in the Old World were of the
later Upper Paleolithic and employed a BLADE technology.  Their scrapers,
burins and other tools were build on BLADES.  Their projectiles were
compound points made of antler and inset with BLADE segments.  <A
HREF="brucebradley2.htm">Bruce's 2nd Comment.</A>

<P>The lithic technology of the Clovis tradition was a flake technology. 
Clovis rarely created blades. Yes, I am aware of the occasional blades
that have been found in some of the Clovis sites across the country.  But,
these few flakes that are twice as long as they are wide are not BLADES
and Clovis was not a BLADE technology. <A
HREF="brucebradley3.htm">Bruce's 3rd Comment.</A>

<P>In my opinion the closest lithic technology, in the Old World, to the
Clovis tradition is the Middle Paleolithic (pre-30,000 BP) which was based
on a flake technology.  The subsequent Upper Paleolithic traditions which
represent a BLADE technology are far more different.  IF THE READER JUST
MISSED THIS, this is a very important inconsistency in the archaeological
data.  At the time Clovis appears in the New World, there are no
antecedent to its lithic technology in the Old World. 

<P>So how do I explain the flake technology of Clovis?  I can find only
two possible models (explanations).  One is there were pre-Clovis people
in the New World who had their roots in the Middle Paleolithic and the
Clovis tradition developed from them. The other is the first inhabitants
in the New World were Clovis from the Upper Paleolithic with a BLADE 
technology and they reverted back to a flake technology upon their
arrival. 

<P>The choice between the above two models is a dilemma.  Both models
require the Clovis point to be developed in the New World. Additionally,
the pre-Clovis model requires an extremely early entry into the New World. 
The Clovis first model does not require an early entry, but it does
require the abandonment of the compound projectile point and the reversion
from a BLADE technology back to the a flake technology.  Since I am lithic
oriented, the pre-Clovis model is more probable to me because it requires
fewer cultural changes to occur prior to the appearance of the Clovis
tradition. <A HREF="brucebradley4.htm">Bruce's
4th Comment.</A>

<P>As I stated above, both models require the development of the Clovis
point in the New World.  I believe this is the general accepted theory and
current available data suggest the same. There have been no Clovis points
found in the the Old World or Alaska. In fact, the oldest Clovis dates now
seem to be coming from the southeast United States which is the middle of
the New World.  So where are the predecessors, the transitional or
developmental projectiles, to the Clovis point in the New World?  One
would expect there would have been some if the pre-Clovis model is
correct?  <A HREF="brucebradley5.htm">Bruce's
5th Comment.</A>

<P>I now want to establish a link between the Solutrean of the Upper
Paleolithic in the Old World and Clovis tradition of the New World. This
link is apparent in the early stages of Clovis point manufacture which
were accomplished by removing large, flat percussion flakes from a biface.
These flakes left scars that extended past the middle of the face of the
biface and created a platelike biface which is different than a biface
with a medial ridge.  Occasionally, these flakes would travel all the way
across the biface and remove a portion of the edge on the far side.  In
France these flakes that run all the way across the biface are known as
outre pass&eacute; flakes.  Flake scars #1 and #2 in the image are
examples of outre pass&eacute; flakes scars.  (Artifacts in the figure are
plastic casts.)

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="outrapas.jpg"></CENTER>

<P>The outrepass&eacute; flake is generally associated with the Solutrean
tradition (17,500 to 19,500 BP) of the Upper Paleolithic.  The later
Solutrean (18,000 BP) is even more famous for its exquisitely thin bifaces
(artifact on the left in the image) that were created with the same soft
hammer percussion technique that the Clovis people used.  Similar to
Clovis, the Solutrean tradition also seems to appear from nowhere and
interrupts the gradually evolving tool kit of the Upper Paleolithic.  Even
though it was and remained a BLADE tradition, it represents sudden changes
in that kit that suggests the Solutrean had some connection back to the
Middle Paleolithic.  For example, there were sudden increases in bifaces
and end scrapers, a decrease in retouched BLADES, and the appearance of
the leaf-shaped flint point with one plane face and the other retouched.

<H3><CENTER>The Theory</CENTER></H3>

<P>I propose that the first people to enter the New World did so before
20,000 BP and probably closer to 30,000 BP.  They crossed the Bering
Strait and gradually, very sparsely, populated both the North and South
American continents.  They were Homo sapiens and not Neanderthals. They
did not make BLADES, spear points or arrowheads, but had a flake
technology that was derived from the Middle Paleolithic.  Sometime between
17,500 and 11,500 BP a few individuals from Europe, not a reproducible
population, found their way into the New World.  They did not bring a gene
pool, but they brought the Solutrean lithic technology from which the
indigenous population adopted the soft hammer percussion technique and the
exquisitely made biface.  The Clovis point was then invented almost
overnight and it spread across the in place population in a very short
time. 

<P>I am sure the reader is now asking, where in the New World are these
Middle Paleolithic sites?  Why have they not been found, yet? 

<P>I propose the answer to the first question is the sites are everywhere
across the two continents of the New World.  I propose these people had
very similar life styles to the Paleoindians.  They were hunter and
gatherers.  They traveled in very small bands most of the time, lived in
open air sites, and stayed only a few days at a site.  As a result, their
sites are small lithic scatters patterned on the landscape much as the
Paleoindians sites are.  Their sites are not in caves. <A
HREF="brucebradley7.htm">Bruce's 7th
Comment.</A>

<P>The answer to the second question of "why have not any of their sites
being found" is, that they HAVE been found.  To explain, I must suggest
that the assemblage from a Middle Paleolithic site without the Levallois
point looks very similar to an early Archaic assemblage without
arrowheads.  Additionally, most of the documented and excavated
Paleoindian sites in the New World have been found by people looking for
arrowheads.  (Since there are and have been many more arrowhead hunters
than archaeologists looking at the ground, this is the obvious outcome.) 
So imagine what an arrowhead hunter does when they find a lithic scatter
that contains no arrowheads.  They walk away and forget it.  The site
never has a chance to get reported to a knowledgeable archaeologist.  In
fact, most archaeologists would do exactly the same thing because this
scenario does not fit their paradigm for a pre-Clovis site. 

<P>As a tangential comment to the above paragraph, I suggest that the
lithic artifacts of these pre-Clovis people will be easy to recognize.
There is no ambiguity in the tools from the Middle Paleolithic in the Old
World and I propose there will be none here in the New World from the
pre-Clovis sites.  Any time a proposed pre-Clovis site in the New World
produces ambiguous lithic artifacts I really have doubts about its
credibility.  Humans have been making recognizable artifacts for hundreds
of thousands of years.  Why would they stop doing so when they entered the
New World?

<P>Another question that the reader might ask, is how did the Solutrean
people get across the Atlantic?  I do not know, however I believe it is
possible when one considers the first peoples to Australia crossed a 100
miles of open water at least 60,000 years ago. Plus, they must have done
it several times because they brought over a reproducible population (>
125 people).  In my theory, I only have to have one Solutrean person make
it to the New World.  They were only carrying ideas. 

<P>I will close this page by reporting several observations I made in
Italy during one of the field trips of the XIII Congress of the U.I.S.P.P. 
There are an abundance of open air and cave sites in Italy that represent
the last 30,000 years.  The deposits in these sites that represent this
time frame are many meters thick. The volume of lithic and fauna debris
within these deposits is staggering.  As a result, in Italy, the
archaeologists can truly have a question to be answered when they begin to
excavate.  This is in contrast to the New World where the archaeologists
are asking where can we excavate?  The Middle and Upper Paleolithic
population per square mile in Europe must have been enormous compared to
those in the New World. 

<P>This abundance of archaeological data in Europe from the last 30,000
years is the chink in my proposed theory.  Although I have attempted to
down play this fact by suggesting open air sites and minimum populations
it still nags at me.  This is the reason I reserve the right to change my
opinions in the future. <A
