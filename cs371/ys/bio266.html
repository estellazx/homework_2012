<center><h1>Lefalophodon</h1>
<h3>An Informal History of Evolutionary Biology Web Site</h3></center>

<p>
This is an informal and incomplete guide to the history of evolutionary biology from about 1800 to about 1950. It is maintained by <a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~alroy/jack.html">John Alroy</a>. Its main emphases are on the late 19th century and on paleontology. However, I hope to see the coverage become more comprehensive in the near future. If you have any comments or suggestions or wish to contribute to the site, I strongly encourage you to do so; please <a href="mailto:alroy@nceas.ucsb.edu">write me</a>. The only limits on contributions are that they must follow the site's format and carry your byline. Contributors to date include Mark Largent.</p>

<p>
<font color="#FF0000">New features</font> on the site include a facelift of the <a href="biblio.html">bibliography page</a>, and a review of <a href="biblio.html#Smith87">Pacific Visions</a> (M. Smith).</p>

<p>
The site's other main features currently are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="pages.html">Biographies</a> of major (and not so major) figures
<li><a href="pages.html">Photo gallery</a>: pages that have photos and little else.
<li>A <a href="timeline.html">timeline</a> of major events between 1800 and 1950
<li>An <a href="biblio.html">annotated bibliography</a> of history of biology books
<li>A <a href="quotes.html">page of Darwin quotes</a>
<li>A <a href="expeditions.html">page detailing major 19th century scientific expeditions</a>
<li>Institutional pages, including:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="AMNH.html">The American Museum of Natural History</a><br>
<li><a href="Chicago.html">The University of Chicago</a><br>
<li><a href="Harvard.html">Harvard University</a><br>
<li><a href="Smithsonian.html">The Smithsonian Institution</a><br>
<li><a href="Naples.html">Stazione Zoologica at Naples</a><p>
</ul>
<li>I am planning to create "famous historical episodes" pages (e.g., for the voyage of the Beagle, the Cope-Marsh war, the case of the midwife toad, etc.).<br>
</ul>
