Molecular Astrophysics concerns the study of emission from molecules in
space.  Lew Snyder recently presented a 
<a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~awootten/allmols.html"> list </a> of the
110 currently known interstellar molecules.  These molecules have large
numbers of observable transitions.  To find specific frequencies, try
Herb Pickett's <a href="http://spec.jpl.nasa.gov/"> Molecular Spectroscopy Home 
Page </a> or <a href="http://physics.nist.gov/restfreq"> Frank Lovas' list </a>
of recommended rest frequencies.  Tom Kuiper has put together
an explanation of <a href="http://dsnra.jpl.nasa.gov/IMS/simple.html">
molecular radio spectroscopy </a> for emission lines.  Lines may
also be observed in absorption--for example the 
<a href="http://puppis.ls.eso.org/staff/tommy/pks1830_spec.html">
highly redshifted lines</a> seen against the 
gravitationally lensed quasar PKS1830-211.
High energy radiation, such as ultraviolet light, can break the
molecular bonds which hold atoms in molecules.  In general then, molecules
are found in cool astrophysical environments.  The most massive objects
in our Galaxy are giant clouds of molecules and dust, creatively named
Giant Molecular Clouds.  In these clouds, and smaller versions of them,
stars and planets are formed.  One of the primary fields of study of
molecular astrophysics then, is star and planet formation.  Molecules may
be found in many environments, however, from stellar atmospheres to those
of planetary satellites.  Most of these locations are cool, and molecular
emission is most easily studied via photons emitted when the molecules make
transitions between low rotational energy states.  One molecule, comprised
of the abundant carbon and oxygen atoms, and very stable against dissociation
into atoms, is carbon monoxide, CO.  The wavelength of the photon emitted
when the CO molecules falls from its lowest excited state to its zero energy,
or ground, state is 2.6mm, or 115 gigahertz (billion hertz).  This frequency
is a thousand times higher than typical FM radio frequencies.  At these
high frequencies, molecules in the Earth's atmosphere can block transmissions
from space, and telescopes must be located in dry (water is an important
atmospheric blocker), high sites.  Radio telescopes must have very accurate
surfaces to produce high fidelity images.  NRAO pioneered development of
accurate antennas and high frequency receivers, and the development of
molecular astrophysics, with the 11m radio telescope.  In 1982, the surface
of the 11m was replaced with a much more accurate 12m surface, pictured above.

Protostars like that in the dark cloud L1157 jettison material from their
poles as they spin down into a stable star.  In this image, of the 2.6mm
transition of CO taken with the NRAO 12m, blueshifted gas, moving towards us
at speeds of 10,000 miles per hour, is color-coded blue, while gas moving
away from us is coded red.  Green stains the quiescent gas in the cloud.
The protostar itself is not visible in this image.  It might best be studied
through emission from warm dust closely associated with it, which radiates in
the millimeter and submillimeter continuum.

As for L1157, red and blue in the image show redshifted and blueshifted jets
of CO (the J=2-1 line at 1.3mm, observed by the IRAM 30m telescope in this case)
emanating from the poles of a protostar.  The region of the star itself
appears in the yellow in this image, which shows continuum emission at 1.3mm.
Note other clumps to the northeast, possible the sites of future star formation.
