  for Reverse Mortgages</strong></p>
      <p class="ptm-body">PTM is dedicated to providing   accurate <a href="http://www.reversemortgageadviser.com">reverse mortgage information</a> for seniors. Reverse mortgage   has made huge positive impacts in the lives of many who have taken the   loan and so PTM strives to make other seniors aware of the loan benefits   so that they too can enjoy the loan features.&nbsp;<br />
          <br />
        While many seniors have benefited   from the reverse mortgage loan program many are still unaware or even   <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/majcases/fraud/seniorsfam.htm">skeptical</a> about reverse mortgage loans. To help inform and educate seniors,   PTM was formed. Our activities also help to answer the lingering questions   that many seniors may still have. Reverse mortgage reverses the equity   of the home of the senior. The home is usually their only asset of value   and so seniors deserves the most information they can get.&nbsp;<br />  
        <br />
        Reverse mortgage loans are   only available for seniors above 62 who have a home of their own. The   loan reverses the accumulated equity on their home and thus affords   them an opportunity to draw funds from that equity. They can draw funds   as fixed monthly income or an open line of credit or even a combination   of both.&nbsp;<br />  
        <br />
        The uniqueness of reverse mortgage   is that the senior beneficiary is not required to repay the loan as   long as they reside in the home as their primary residence. They are   not obligated to repay and do not even bear any risk of losing the home.   The lender remains unpaid until the home is sold or the senior moves   out of it. The funds from reverse mortgage loans have benefited many   seniors to take better care of themselves during retirement. They do   not have to move out from their home and do not have to be a burden   to anyone.<br />
        <br />
      PTM is poised to continue to   provide needed information to help seniors. We partner with accredited   reverse mortgage lenders to organize reverse mortgage seminars and workshops   all over the country. The workshops provide seniors an opportunity to   learn about reverse mortgages and even to sign for the loans.<br />
