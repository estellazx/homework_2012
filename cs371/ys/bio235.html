<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Welcome to the Dynamics of Development!</H1>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>This set of web pages is designed to provide supplementary
material for the teaching of developmental biology to undergraduates. This
project was originally begun with support from the Lilly Teaching Fellows
Program and the National Science Foundation Young Investigator Program.
It is an ongoing project to make dynamic data available to students that
can be viewed outside of the classroom, and was originally designed as a
supplement to Jeff Hardin's <A HREF="/classes/zoo470.html">Zoology 470 -
Introduction to Animal Development</A> course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</P>
