<A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2"><H2><B>OVERVIEW</B></H2></A>

LASSPTools is a collection of Unix utilities for numerical analysis and
graphics. It was written around 1990, before Linux, before the World Wide Web.
Considering that, many of the tools remain remarkably useful.
<P>

The operating system of most computers is designed around
their primary use: text processing.  We provide the
same system utilities for number crunching and dynamical displays of
results that are available for sorting, searching, and manipulating
text files.  The files are available without charge
<A HREF="http://www.lassp.cornell.edu/lassp_pub">via the World Wide Web.</A>
<P>

For example, it's currently an incredible pain to plot spheres on your
screen.  We've cured this with 
<A HREF="http://www.msc.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cgiman?PlotAtoms.1">
PlotAtoms.</A>
<P>

<A HREF="pictures/PlotAtomsDemo.mpg"><IMG SRC="pictures/PlotAtomsDemo.gif">
</A>
<P>

Pipe your coordinates to PlotAtoms, and you immediately have a movie
of your results!  Selecting the figure above will show an mpeg film
captured from the original: the quality and speed of the mpeg film
is much inferior to the original.  <A HREF="mpeg.html#PlotAtoms">Other
examples are also available.</A>
<P>

The LASSP Software toolkit is a set of more than 35 programs for assisting
researchers in physics and engineering.  The tools are 
<A HREF="http://www.lassp.cornell.edu/lassp_pub/">available</A>
on Linux (recompiled April 2002), and have been compiled on a variety of
other Unix platforms. LASSPTools was developed at Cornell University 
as part of the Cornell-IBM Joint Study on Computing for Scientific Research.
<P>

The tools perform various functions and roughly can be grouped into the
following categories:<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="graphics.toc" HREF="#graphics">Graphics and
Animation:</A></STRONG> Display matrices, lattice dynamics simulations,
polygons and polygonalized surfaces, circles and spheres: watch them
change with time.

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="input.toc" HREF="#input">Analog Input
Devices</A></STRONG> Input numbers with slider bars, input rotation
matrices to turn your figures in three dimensions...

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="numerical.toc" HREF="#numerical">Numerical
Analysis</A></STRONG> Fourier transforms, matrix eigenvalues,
inversions, rotations - all as Unix filters.

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="filter.toc" HREF="#filter">Data filtering</A></STRONG>
sort, prune, histogram, ...

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="utils.toc" HREF="#utils">Miscellaneous
Utilities</A></STRONG> (some of which were written outside of our
project). </UL>

The programs typically are used together in pipelines to generate,
manipulate and display data. For example, raw data may be run through a
numerical transformation, a section selected via a filtering program and
the results sent to a program to animate the results graphically.<P>


<A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3"><H2><B>SETUP</B></H2></A>

In our local setup, we store LASSPTools in `/usr/local/pub/tools', and
set our path variables to search there for executables and man pages.<P>

To run the programs, you must have `/usr/local/pub/tools/bin' in your
`path' environment variable.  Here at LASSP, we have an
example of this in `/usr/local/skel/.cshrc'.<P>

To access the documentation, you must have `/usr/local/pub/tools/man' in
your MANPATH environment variable.  Locals can see an example of this in<BR>
`/usr/local/skel/.login'.<P>

<A NAME="sect5" HREF="#toc5"><H2><B>SOURCE AND BINARIES</B></H2></A>

a two-dimensional square (or rectangular) lattice based on their value.
This program is &quot;dynamic&quot; in that sites are typically read
individually from the standard input stream (stdin) and plotted one at a
time. There are three modes of representation: shading, arrows and
bonds. The default mode is shading, whereby sites are filled with a
colored cell whose color represents the value of the plotted field at
that site. In the arrow mode, an arrow is plotted at the specified site
where its angle represents the value of the field at that site. In the
bond mode, a specified bond is drawn from a site to a neighboring site.
In both the arrow and bond modes, the symbol can also be colored to
represent another quantity. If such information is not given, all
arrows/bonds are colored the same.  <A HREF="mpeg.html#DynamicLattice">

- Poly2ps is filter to produce a PostScript file which draws and shades
polygons. It is designed to read the same input file (ASCII format only)
that polydraw reads. The default is to convert the specified RGB colors
to grayscales. This conversion is hard to make general. It will probably
need modification unless your color scheme is quite simple (e.g., you
draw only red, green, and blue polygons). Alternatively, color
postscript output can be created.<P>

<A HREF="http://www.msc.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cgiman?axis.1">axis</A> -

abscissas and ordinates of a graph. Successive points are connected by
straight lines. The graph is encoded on the standard output for display
by the <A
HREF="http://www.msc.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cgiman?plot.1">plot</A>
filters (for example hpgl or tek10). If the coordinates of a point are
followed by a nonnumeric string, that string is printed as a label
beginning on the point.<P>

<A
HREF="http://www.msc.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cgiman?movieaxis.1">movieaxis</A>
- See axis. This variant allows multiple, movie style, plots to be
generated.<P>

<A HREF="http://www.msc.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cgiman?branch.1">branch</A>

splits it into two output streams. One output stream is sent to the
first command and the other to the second command. Note that both
commands my have pipes in them.<P>

<A
HREF="http://www.msc.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cgiman?inter.1">inter</A> -
Inter frees the user from the constrained input file format required by
axis, and replaces axis's cryptic commands with real words. The user
types commands, or inter reads them from commandfile. If you don't want
to remember or learn the appropriate commands, inter0 asks questions
instead of waiting for instructions.<P>

<A HREF="http://www.msc.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cgiman?laser.1">laser</A> -

to a printer.<P>
