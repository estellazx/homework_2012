 <h1>MAD COW DISEASE<br> The BSE Epidemic in Great Britain</h1>

The announcement by British health authorities that bovine

spongiform  encephalopathy (BSE, pictured in medulla of cow,

left), also known as  mad cow disease, may have been 

transmitted to humans has led to a chaotic situation in the UK

with ripple  effects occurring throughout Europe and the rest of

the world. What is BSE  and what is its relation to scrapie in

sheep and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease  (CJD) in humans? How did

the current epidemic begin?  <p> I asked Frederick A.  Murphy,
DVM,

PhD, Dean of the School of Veterinary Medicine at the 

University of California, Davis these and other questions in an

attempt to  sort out the science from the media hysteria

surrounding the announcement  from the UK on March 21, 1996 that

10 people may have become infected with  the BSE agent through

exposure to beef.



<p> <br>

<hr> <p> <br> <B> Let's start at the beginning. What exactly is
BSE?</B>



<p>

 BSE, that is bovine spongiform

encephalopathy, also known in Britain as  the  mad cow disease, 

is a progressive, lethal central nervous system  disease of

cattle. It is characterized by the appearance in neurons in the 

brain of affected cattle of vacuoles, clear holes, that give the

brain the  appearance of a sponge -- this is where the term

spongiform came from.



<p> <br> <b>What is the reason for the current panic?

What is the link, if any,  between BSE in cattle, scrapie in

sheep and CJD in humans?</b>



<p>

 BSE was initially recognized in cattle in

the UK in 1986; there is good  information that it had not

occurred before then. Epidemiological research  led to the

conclusion that the bovine agent had originated from the scrapie

agent, which had been present in sheep in the United Kingdom for

at least  200 years. It is presumed, but will likely never be

proven, that the scrapie agent  jumped species  and moved into

cattle when sheep offal (the leftover  parts of butchered

animals) was included in protein supplements fed to  cattle.

After cattle started to die, cattle carcasses and offal were 

included in the same protein supplements -- this seems to have

amplified the  epidemic. 

 <p> 



The epidemic in cattle in Britain reached incredible

proportions; by 1993  more than 1,000 cases per week were being

reported. More than 160,000  infected cows have now been

identified, involving more than 50% of the dairy  herds in the

UK. Protein supplements containing sheep and cattle offal were 

banned in the UK in 1988, but it was not until 1991-1992 that

the ban was  strictly enforced. Given the long incubation of

BSE, the epidemic curve  (number of new cases reported per week)

didn't start downward until late  1993. It is now down to about

250 cases per week..



<p>



Even by 1990 when the epidemic curve was on the upswing,

questions were  raised in many quarters in the UK, "...does BSE

pose a risk to human  health?" British government officials at

the time said  don't worry, there  is nothing to worry about. 

This of course only led the public to become  more skeptical.

Even then, in 1990, the editors of the British journal  Nature

reacted, saying: "...Never say there is no danger {risk}.

Instead,  say that there is always a danger {risk), and that the

problem is to  calculate what it is. Never say that the risk is

negligible unless you are  sure that your listeners share your

own philosophy of life..." I think this  advice has come back to

haunt British officials again, six years later.



<p>



The next chapter started with the announcement on March 21, 1996

of 10 cases  of CJD in people not otherwise considered at high

risk. These individuals  were much younger than the usual cases

of CJD that occur sporadically  everywhere in the world at an

incidence of about one per million population  per year. This

sporadic incidence of CJD is the same even in countries, like 

Australia, where there is no scrapie. Also, there have been

statements in  the press, but no details, that the pathologic

changes in the brains of  these 10 patients are different from

those in usual CJD cases. In any case,  it is the

age-distribution of these 10 cases (average age 27 vs. 63 for 

sporadic CJD cases) that led the British expert committee to

make its  startling announcement.



<p> <br>

<b>So, the problem in the UK can be traced to

feed supplements containing  infected cow and sheep parts?</b>



<p>

 In the early 1980s in England the rendering

process (by which livestock  carcasses are converted to various

products, including protein supplements  for livestock feed) was

changed. Earlier, a solvent extraction step had been  used to

extract fats (tallow); this step was stopped when the price of

the  petroleum-based solvents used to extract fats went up. The

infectious agent  is solvent-sensitive. Otherwise, the

infectious agent is extremely hardy --  it can survive boiling

and many disinfectants, but is readily destroyed by  extremely

high temperature (such as in an autoclave), or by oxidizing 

agents, or by solvents.



<p>



Of course, this change in the rendering process was only part of

the story  -- in tracing the source of the problem other

practices employed in the  livestock industries of the UK have

to be assessed -- and the still  mysterious events that likely

led to the  species jump  of the scrapie agent  into cattle must

be assessed too.



<p> <br>

<b>Our knowledge of CJD goes back to earlier

studies of kuru, the so called  headhunter disease seen in Papua

New Guinea, where people became infected  after eating the

brains of their foes and preparing their dead relatives for 

burial. How are these diseases related?</b>



<p>

 Kuru and CJD should be thought of as two

different spongiform  encephalopathies. Kuru studies were

instructive since they showed for the  first time that a slowly

progressive neurological disease of humans can be  infectious,

that is transmitted from one person to another. For this 

discovery Carleton Gajdusek was awarded the Nobel Prize.

Recently, as the  power of molecular biology has been applied to

the spongiform  encephalopathies, it has become clear that each

disease (scrapie, BSE, and  others in animals, and CJD, kuru and

Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease in humans) is caused by a

distinct variant prion.



<p> <br> <b>You've mentioned prions. What are they? How

are they associated with the  pathogenesis of these diseases?</b>



<p>

Prions are the most bizarre infectious

agents ever imagined. It was  Stanley Prusiner of the University

of California, San Francisco, who first  discovered the nature

of prions and suggested they are the causative agents  of the

spongiform encephalopathies. For this he won the prestigious

Lasker  Prize two years ago. Prions (pronounced  pree-ons ) are

proteins,  rogue proteins,  and nothing  else. They contain no

nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). They consist of a single  molecule

containing about 250 amino acids, termed the PrP protein. They

are  abnormal variants of proteins that occur normally in cells,

such as human  brain cells. Amazingly, abnormal PrP proteins,

when they enter the body, are  able to convert their normal

counterparts into more of the abnormal forms.  The difference

between the normal and abnormal proteins does not lie in  their

primary structure (the sequence of their amino acids), but

rather in  their folding -the abnormal PrP proteins are folded

in a way that allows  them to resist normal protease degradation

so that over time this leads to  the build up of aggregates of

PrP, especially in neurons in the brain. These  aggregates

resemble the tangles of abnormal protein found in neurons in 

Alzheimer s disease patients, but as in Alzheimer s disease, we

do not know  how the presence of these tangles causes neurologic

disease.



<p>



Prions are the only "life forms" that break the great "central

dogma" of  biology. That is, we have come to expect that all 

life forms  from viruses  to bacteria to plants to humans to

hand down the blueprints for all their  progeny via their DNA

(except for some viruses which carry their blueprints  as an RNA

genome), and we expect that the process for converting the 

blueprints into building blocks must involve replication of DNA,

transcription of the message into RNA, and translation of the

RNA s message  to form proteins, the building blocks of cells,

tissues, organs and whole  organisms. Here we have  life forms 

where abnormal proteins, the PrP  proteins, direct the refolding

of normal proteins just by direct contact.



<p>



PrPs from the various spongiform encephalopathies have been

sequenced and  found to differ, in some cases by very little, in

some cases by quite a bit.  For example, recent research has

shown that the scrapie PrP protein differs  from the BSE PrP

protein at only seven amino acid loci, whereas the BSE PrP 

protein differs from the human CJD PrP at more than 30 loci.

These  differences explain the concept of  strains  and help

explain why prions  from one species might jump more easily into

another species than another.  It is difficult to find the terms

to discuss prions -- for example, can we  talk about  mutants 

when there is no DNA? What would Watson and Crick think  of all

this?



<p> <br>

<b>Are there factors that may predispose an

animal or human to infection?  After all, it would seem that

many more people are exposed to prions than  actually get

disease?</b>



<p>

 In a nutshell, the answer to this question

is,  we don t know. It s true  in every disease that there are

more exposures than infections. And it s  true that in most

cases we don't know why one person or animal gets infected  and

another doesn't. With the prion diseases, we don't know much

about a  dose effect -- beyond a  minimum infectious dose,  does

a big dose of prions  lead to a higher probability of infection

or a faster progression to  clinical disease? In the real-world

setting, what do we know about how easy  it was for prions

contained in feed supplements to enter a cow's body? The  answer

is,  not much. 



<p> <br>

<b> How is a prion different from a virus? What

does a virus have that a  prion does not?</b>



<p>

 As President of the International Committee

on the Taxonomy of Viruses,  I've had to wrestle with this

question -- in our most recent report, we have  a chapter on

prions, contributed by a study group chaired by Stanley 

Prusiner. This chapter is included in a section entitled 

sub-viral agents.   This title has allowed us to avoid the

question, to keep our definition of  virus  intact, to hold to a

sense that a virus should have a nucleic acid  (DNA or RNA)

genome, and still keep the prions under the wing of virologists 

around the world. After all, it is virologists who care most

about prions,  and it is virology meetings and virology journals

where scientific progress  on prions and prion diseases is

reported.



<p> <br> <b>What about the hypothesis that prions are

not infectious themselves, but  serve only as a kind of virus

activator?</b>



<p>

 People who still believe that there has to

be some nucleic acid somewhere  in the picture have been caught

out in the cold by all the recent progress  in our understanding

of the nature of prions. Perhaps these people have to 

rationalize some direct role of a nucleic acid in the infectious

moiety and  so they envision some kind of activator role for the

prion, acting in  concert with a yet-to-be-found traditional

virus. As the nature of prions  becomes better known, I think

this idea will fade away.



<p> <br>

<b>Is there any evidence that CJD can appear as

a genetic disease?</b>



<p>

 Yes, there is a familial form of CJD,

accounting for about 10% of cases.  In the familial disease

there is are mutations in the gene encoding the  normal protein

such that the protein tends to fold in the abnormal way and 

tends to pile up into aggregates in brain cells with lethal

consequences.



<p> <br>

<b>How do we know that these new cases of

so-called BSE disease in humans  are not CJD? How can we tell if

someone got CJD from a cow, or if they got  it from their

grandfather?</b>

 <p> We can tell by genetic analysis. This has

been well studied in the  familial form of CJD. The prion

protein in familial cases is the same in  each family member

that has it, and different in all other families.  Sometimes the

difference is as small as one amino acid, but these  differences

can be used to determine the pedigree of the prion. I'm sure 

such analyses are being applied to the 10 cases just reported in

the UK.



<p> <br>

<b>The British announcement has raised

questions not only about the safety  of British beef, but

British milk and dairy products as well. What is known  about

this?</b>



<p>

 There has never been any evidence of any

prion being transmitted through  milk. Although, we don't know

if prions can occur in the milk of a cow with  BSE, there is

very good epidemiologic evidence that this is not a route of 

transmission. For example, if the BSE prion was transmitted in

cow s milk,  wouldn't we expect to see BSE in calves fed on such

milk? There are solid  data from the UK that such calves have

not become infected.



<p> <br>

<b>There is a report that the French are

worried about infection via  cosmetics containing animal

products? Is this far fetched?</b>



<p>

 It seems far fetched to me. Cosmetics are

full of lipid-solvent-based  chemicals which would be very

destructive to prions.



<p> <br>

<b>What about the political impact of the BSE

epidemic?</b>



<p>

 The global political impact has been

incredible. We're now reading that  this might be the ultimate

crisis for Prime Minister Major's Tory  government, and could

lead to its downfall. There are also huge economic  costs. Some

estimates go as high as $50 billion, with 300,000 jobs at risk. 

At the recent Turin (Italy) meeting of the leaders of the

European  Community, representatives of European countries even

brought up questions  concerning the pace of the unification of

Europe. Even though it has now  been decided that quite a bit of

the cost of eliminating BSE from British  cattle will be shared

among other European governments, I don t think we ve  heard the

last of these tensions at the highest levels of governments.



<p> <br>

<b>What are public health authorities doing in

the US?</b>



<p>

 There was just a big meeting in Washington

with people from the American  agricultural sector, veterinary

medicine, USDA, and cattlemen groups.  Ruminant (cattle and

sheep) -based feeds are already excluded in the US on a 

voluntary basis, but this will soon become an FDA regulation.



<p>



There is no indication of BSE infection in US cattle. APHIS, the

Animal and  Plant Health Inspection Service of the USDA, will be

increasing its  surveillance measures. In my personal opinion,

this kind of direct  surveillance based upon histopathological

examination of brains of selected  cattle, has been modest in

scope and scale until now -- I suspect that the  level of such

surveillance will increase. Another kind of surveillance is 

also ticking up: trained APHIS inspectors working in cattle

sales yards and  slaughter house yards are on the lookout for

animals with clinical signs of  BSE. Education is also being

improved for practicing veterinarians and  farmers. The USDA has

also announced that it will increase its research in  this area.



<p> <br>

<b>So, do you feel confident eating US beef?</b>



<p>

 Absolutely -- I m a beef eater, always will

be. Last year the concern in  this country was over E. coli
0:157 in hamburgers. As you will recall,  cooking

temperatures were raised to kill the bug in ground beef. We

survived  that scare, and now we eat fast-food hamburgers

without a second thought. In  regard to BSE, the American public

should feel confident in eating  American-grown beef -- the BSE

prion has never been found in our country.



<p> <br>

<b>Similar encephalopathy has been reported in

cats in England. Is there a  risk of pet-to-owner
transmission?</b>



<p>

 Other animals in the UK exposed to the same

protein supplements as cows,  such as some zoo animals, did get

infected. Indeed, cats began to get the  disease about the same

time as the BSE epidemic began in cattle in Britain.  Whether

these cats got infected from the same feed products (such as

bone  meal as well as protein supplements) that cows were

eating, or whether they  got infected by being fed infected meat

products is not likely ever to be  known. In any case, I cannot

imagine any circumstance whereby humans might  be at risk from

their cats.



<p> <br> <b>What about the gardener who just put bone

meal on his gladiolus bulbs.  Could he be inhaling prions?</b>



<p>

 If the gardener is in America, the bone meal

would have come from  American livestock. Since there is no

evidence that BSE occurs in this  country, that risk would seem

vanishingly small. We don't know what the risk  to a British

gardener might be because we don't know enough about the 

transmission of the BSE agent. All in all, I call this a 

...what if...?   question -one can go on and on asking such

question, never pausing for  answers, never getting anywhere.



<p> <br> <b>Is the US government responding adequately?</b>



<p>

I would say, yes. As I mentioned, our

agricultural sector, our USDA, has  taken this matter very

seriously and is doing many things to minimize risk.  Our health

sector, our CDC and State health departments, are on top of the 

matter as well. I would like to see a better interaction between

surveillance, research and public education between the health

sector and  agricultural sector. In my view, veterinary medicine

is right in the middle  of all this -- serving as a health

science and as an agricultural science --  communicating with

people across all turf boundaries. I expect that my  colleagues

in veterinary medicine in our country will play a major role in 

our national response over the coming months. My colleagues in

veterinary  medicine in the UK have done a fine job -- their

sound scientific  recommendations have, however, been caught up

in the mega-political mess  that would overwhelm any

scientifically based activities.



<p> <br> <b>What are the research priorities now?</b>



<p>

 At the heart of the matter we're dealing

with the abnormal folding of a  native bovine protein. This

protein, the abnormal PrP protein, is not  immunogenic and

doesn't seem like a reasonable target for vaccine  development.



<p>



The number one need is for a diagnostic test that could be used

for early  diagnosis in cattle and humans. We keep hearing that

such tests are  forthcoming immediately, but I've heard that for

several years now and we  still do not have such tests. Whenever

such a test comes along, it will then  be along time before it

could be validated and proof tested in the field. I  think this

development should be a national priority.



<p>



What would such a test be like? It can't be a DNA or RNA probe

since the  gene encoding the PrP protein is a normal constituent

of the body. It may  have to be an immunological test, one that

is specific for the abnormally  folded shape of the PrP protein.



<p> <br> <b>What do you think could form the basis for

treatment of these  prion-related encephalopathies?</b> 



<p>

 For cattle with BSE there will not likely

ever be a treatment -slaughter  will continue to be the

end-game. Stanley Prusiner thinks that for humans with CJD one

tack should involve  designing drugs that would stabilize the

normal protein throughout the body,  preventing its refolding

into the abnormal PrP protein. Prusiner also thinks  that

antisense technology may prove useful. This might involve

delivering  into human brains engineered genes that would block

those genes that give  rise to unwanted proteins. Of course,

this would require that the normal  protein from which abnormal

PrP proteins derive are not essential-- so far  we do not know

what the function of the normal protein may be. Progress in 

this area could spin off and provide keys for Alzheimer's

research as well.  All this would seem to represent years of

research.
