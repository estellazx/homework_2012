  <h1>The Dual Nature of Light as Reflected in the Nobel Archives</h1>

  <p class="smalltext">by G&ouml;sta
  Ekspong<a href=
  "#footnote">*</a></p>
  <p>The research leading to an understanding of the nature of
    light and the emission and absorption processes has been of
    paramount importance. It led from a beginning in 1900 to the
    development of quantum physics, reaching a high peak in the 1920s
    and a fruition towards the mid-century years with the completion
    of the very successful Quantum ElectroDynamic (QED) theory.<br />
    <br />
    The manner in which these achievements have been treated by the
    Nobel Committee for Physics is both interesting and in some cases
    surprising.</p> 
 

  <h2>The Wave-Particle Duality</h2>

  <p>A particle on the classical view is a
  concentration of energy and other properties in space and time,
  whereas a wave is spread out over a larger region of space and
  time. The question whether light are streams of particles
  (corpuscles) or waves is a very old one. This <i>"either -
  or"</i> formulation was classically natural and alien to the
  advanced <i>"both - and"</i> even the <i>"neither - nor"</i>
  solution of today. Early in the nineteenth century experiments
  were suggested and made to show that light is a wave motion. A
  key figure in this endeavour was Thomas Young, one of the most
  intelligent and clever scientists ever to live, who studied
  diffraction and interference of light already in 1803 with
  results that gave strong support to the wave theory of Christian
  Huygens as opposed to the particle or corpuscular theory of Isaac
  Newton. Further contributions were made by many other
  researchers, among them Augustin Jean Fresnel, who showed that
  light is a transverse wave.</p>

        laser) and the detector (here a screen). Waves emerging
        from one slit are superimposed on waves from the other
        slit, producing the observed interference pattern with
        alternate dark and bright lines on the screen.<span class="copy"><br />

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Newton's theory of light had seemed
    suitable to explain the straight-line casting of sharp shadows of
    objects placed in a light beam. But wave theory was needed to
    explain interference where the light intensity can be enhanced in
    some places and diminished in other places behind a screen with a
    slit or several slits. The wave theory is also able to account
    for the fact that the edges of a shadow are not quite
    sharp.<br />
    <br />
    The mathematical theory of electromagnetism by James Clerk
    Maxwell, set up in 1864, led to the view that light is of
    electromagnetic nature, propagating as a wave from the source to
    the receiver. Heinrich Hertz discovered experimentally the
    existence of electromagnetic waves at radio-frequencies in the
    1880s. Maxwell died in 1879 and Hertz died only 37 years old in
    1894, two years before Alfred Nobel's death.<br />
    <br />
    At the end of the 19th century, which also is the time when the
    Nobel Prizes were instituted, the wave nature of light seemed
    definitely established. Thus the decisive research into the wave
    nature of light came too early to be considered for Nobel Prizes.
    However, there is one exception - the case of X-rays.<br />
    <br />
    Discoveries relating to the particle nature of light belong to
    our century and thus one might expect Nobel Prizes be awarded for
    such achievements. This is almost true - but the Nobel archive
    tells a more complicated story as will be uncovered below.</p>

  <h3>The Nobel Prizes for X-rays</h3>
  <p>The discovery of X-rays by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1901/index.html">Wilhelm Conrad
  R&ouml;ntgen</a> in 1895 was honoured by the first Nobel Prize in
  Physics in 1901. R&ouml;ntgen had shown among many other things
  that X-rays like light, were propagating in straight lines but in
  contrast to light very penetrating through matter. R&ouml;ntgen
  foresaw the importance to medical science of his discovery.<br />
  <br />
  This discovery had so many important consequences that it well
  fulfills the stipulation in Alfred Nobel's <a href=
  "/alfred_nobel/will/index.html">will</a> of
  having "conferred the greatest benefit on mankind". After 1912
  when <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1914/index.html">Max von
  Laue</a>, who was awarded the 1914 Nobel Prize in Physics, had
  suggested and observed refraction of X-rays did the wave picture
  obtain general acceptance.</p>

    </tr>
  </table>

  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The interatomic distances in a crystal
    match quite well the wavelengths of X-rays. von Laue worked out
    the theory for diffraction in a 3-dimensional grating and made
    predictions, which were verified by the experiments of W.
    Friedrich and P. Knipping.    </p>
  <p>The nature of the new radiation, discovered by R&ouml;ntgen in
      1895, was by no means clear in 1901 when he was awarded the Nobel
      Prize. In the beginning the only property which was found in
      common with light was that of propagation in straight lines. As
      late as 1910 a heated debate occurred between <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1917/index.html">Barkla</a> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1915/index.html">Bragg</a>; one defending the
      idea that X-rays are waves like light, the other that they
      consist of streams of little bullets.</p>
  <p>The Nobel Lecture by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1927/index.html">Arthur H. Compton</a> in
  1927 was entitled "X-rays as a Branch of Optics". It begins, "One
  of the most fascinating aspects of recent physics research has
  been the gradual extension of familiar laws of optics to the very
  high frequencies of X-rays, until at the present there is hardly
  a phenomenon in the realm of light whose parallel is not found in
  the realm of X-rays. Reflection, refraction, diffuse scattering,
  polarization, diffraction, emission and absorption spectra,
  photoelectric effect, all of the essential characteristics of
  light have been found also to be characteristic of X-rays. At the
  same time it has been found that some of these phenomena undergo
  a gradual change as we proceed to the extreme frequencies of
  X-rays, and as a result of these changes in the laws of optics we
  have gained new information regarding the nature of light."</p>

  <h3>Evidence for the Particle Nature of Light</h3>

  <p>In physics textbooks two phenomena are
  usually quoted demonstrating the particle nature of light: 1) the
  photoelectric effect and 2) the Compton scattering of
  X-rays.<br />
  <br />
  In some not so critical texts a third circumstance is erronously
  quoted, namely <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/index.html">Planck</a>'s discovery of
  energy quanta, which he did in his analysis of heat radiation.
  The Nobel Committee honoured this monumental discovery by the
  Physics Prize in 1918, but did not make the mistake to give
  Planck credit for having discovered the particle nature of
  light.</p>

  <h3>The Nobel Prize for Physics to Max Planck</h3>

  <p>Planck's discovery of what is called
  Planck's constant <sub><img src="images/fig-5.gif" width="13" height=
  "14" alt="h" /></sub>, was emphasized as motivation for his prize
  in 1918. This new constant of nature (with the dimension of
  energy multiplied by time) connects the quantum of energy with
  the frequency of light, <img src="images/upsilon.gif" width="13" height=
  "14" alt=" upsilon" />, through the formula <img src="images/fig-2.gif" width=
  "38" height="14" alt=" " />. In the presentation at the Nobel
  Prize ceremony in 1918 it was said , "The product <sub><img src=
  "images/fig-4a.gif" width="19" height="14" alt="hv" /></sub>is actually
  the smallest amount of heat which can be radiated at the
  vibration frequency <img src="images/upsilon.gif" width="13" height="14"
  alt="v" />." Planck himself resisted the idea that light in vacuum
  propagates as particles, later on called photons.<br />
  <br />
  As will be clear from the following, the Nobel Committee for
  Physics did not recognise the particle nature of light neither
  when awarding the 1921 Prize (awarded in 1922) to <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/index.html">Albert Einstein</a> "for his
  discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect," nor when in
  1927 awarding Arthur Holly Compton the Physics Prize "for his
  discovery of the effect named after him."</p>

<h3>The 1921 Nobel Prize to Albert Einstein (awarded in
  1922)</h3>

  <p>Albert Einstein in 1905 drew the conclusion
  that light sometimes behaves as particles through an ingenious
  statistical analysis of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1911/index.html">Wien</a>'s formula for the
  wave length distribution of heat radiation.<br />
  <br />
  Einstein saw that his new idea would provide a natural
  explanation of the photoelectric effect, i.e. the emission of
  electrons from metal surfaces illuminated by light. The wave
  theory of light was quite unable to do so. The motivation for the
  Nobel Prize to Einstein in 1922 was based on his discovery of the
  law of the photoelectric effect.</p>
  
  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/einstein.gif" width="103" height="144" alt=

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td class="caption"><div align="center">

        </div>
       
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Einstein repeated the statistical
    calculation with Planck's formula as the basis, which is more
    general than Wien's, and drew the conclusion that both the
    concept of waves and the concept of particles in the light heat
    bath in a cavity are called for. During a seminar discussion at
    the Prussian Academy in Berlin in 1909 Einstein used this new
    calculation in order to try to convince Planck and others present
    of the necessity to consider light also as consisting of a number
    of independent particles.<br />
    <br />
    As is well known Einstein did not get the Nobel Prize for his
    relativity theories due to strong disbeliefs in those theories
    among some influential members of the Royal Swedish Academy of
    Sciences. The 1911 Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine
    <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1911/index.html">Allvar
    Gullstrand</a> was of the opinion that the correctness of
    Einstein's special relativity theory rested on belief - not
    proven facts, and the general relativity theory could in his
    opinion not stand a critical analysis.<br />
    <br />
    Now, does not the prize to Einstein imply that the Academy
    recognised the particle nature of light? The Nobel Committee says
    that Einstein had found that the energy exchange between matter
    and ether occurs by atoms emitting or absorbing a quantum of
    energy, <sub><img src="images/fig-4a.gif" width="19" height="14" alt=
  "hv" /></sub>.<br />
    <br />
    As a consequence of the new concept of light quanta (in modern
    terminology photons) Einstein proposed the law that an electron
    emitted from a substance by monochromatic light with the
    frequency <img src="images/upsilon.gif" width="13" height="14" alt=
  "" />has to have a maximum energy of <img src="images/fig-3.gif" width=
  "54" height="13" alt="E=hv-P" />, where <sub><img src="images/fig-6.gif"
  width="12" height="14" alt="p" /></sub>is the energy needed to
    remove the electron from the substance. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1923/index.html">Robert Andrews Millikan</a>
    carried out a series of measurements over a period of 10 years,
    finally confirming the validity of this law in 1916 with great
    accuracy. Millikan had, however, found the idea of light quanta
    to be unfamiliar and strange.<br />
    <br />
    The Nobel Committee avoids committing itself to the particle
    concept. Light-quanta or with modern terminology, photons, were
    explicitly mentioned in the reports on which the prize decision
    rested only in connection with emission and absorption processes.
    The Committee says that the most important application of
    Einstein's photoelectric law and also its most convincing
    confirmation has come from the use <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Bohr</a> made of it in his
    theory of atoms, which explains a vast amount of spectroscopic
    data.</p>

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td class="caption"><div align="center">Niels Henrik David Bohr</div>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In his theory of the atoms Bohr used the
    law of Einstein as the basic condition for the frequency of light
    emitted or absorbed, when an atom makes a transition between two
    quantized energy levels <sub><img src="images/fig-7.gif" width="18"
  height="18" alt="E1" /></sub>and <sub><img src="images/fig-8.gif" width=
  "20" height="18" alt="E2" /></sub>, in the form <sub><img src=
  "images/fig-9.gif" width="90" height="19" alt=" " /></sub>, which in
    modern texts is nothing but basic energy conservation with a
    photon emitted or absorbed as the case may be. Bohr, however,
    resisted the concept of photons for many years, until about 1925.
    In his 1922 Nobel lecture Bohr expressed his opposition in the
    following words: "In spite of its heuristic value the hypothesis
    of light quanta, which is quite irreconcilable with the so-called
    interference phenomena, is not able to throw light on the nature
    of radiation." Einstein was invited to receive his prize at the
    same event, but could not come, because of his journey to Japan.
    Thus the world missed the opportunity to witness an early
    discussion between these two giants of physics about the nature
    of light.</p>
  <p>The connection between Einstein and Bohr,
  which the Nobel Committee for physics saw, was made manifest by
  the two Nobel Prizes decided in 1922: the reserved one from the
  earlier year to Einstein and the current one to Bohr.</p>


  <h3>The Nobel Prize to Arthur Holly Compton (1927)</h3>

  <p>Early in 1923 Arnold Sommerfeld visited the
  USA and wrote to Bohr: "The most interesting thing ..is the work
  of Compton in St Louis.... After it the wave theory of X-rays
  will become invalid."<br />
  <br />
  Compton had followed up an observation that some parts of X-rays
  were scattered away from the beam direction with a longer wave
  length than the incoming radiation. He measured the shift in
  wave-length very accurately. The shift is impossible to
  understand on classical wave theory. Compton's own explanation
  for the scattering process was as in terms of a collision between
  two particles - one being a free electron, the other a
  photon.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Based on quantum theory and relativistic
    kinematics Compton calculated what shift of wave length to expect
    on this theory using the laws of energy and momentum
    conservation. His measurements agreed perfectly with the
    predictions. Compton used an X-ray spectrometer for accurate
    measurements of the wave-length of the scattered radiation, which
    consists of two components - one shifted and one with no shift.
    The shifted component is due to scattering against free or almost
    free electrons, so that they may recoil, thereby taking up
    momentum and a sizeable amount of energy, whereas the unshifted
    component is due to scattering against bound electrons, in which
    case the whole atom or even crystal takes up momentum but only a
    negligible amount of energy.<br />
    <br />
    The understanding of how such a spectrometer as used by Compton
    functions is based on the wave theory of X-rays. By this he found
    that X-rays scatter as particles. This fact illustrates clearly
    the dual nature of light.<br />
    <br />
    Compton was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1927, sharing
    it with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1927/index.html">C.T.R.Wilson</a> for his
    cloud chamber, with which Wilson had observed the recoil
    electrons from the X-ray beam, thus giving strong support for the
    validity of the Compton process.<br />
    <br />
    Did the Academy now finally award the prize for the discovery of
    the particle nature of light? The answer is no.<br />
    <br />
    In the evaluation report one finds a sentence saying that
    Compton's theory must now be considered obsolete in view of the
    latest theories. Thus the particle picture is not accepted.<br />
    <br />
    The position taken by the Nobel Committee is understandable,
    since at the time of Compton's Nobel Prize there was no good
    theory for the differential cross section based on the photon
    concept. Such theories were still in the future. But there were
    theories based on the wave picture, treating both the electrons
    and the X-radiation as waves, also giving the correct wave length
    shift.<br />
    <br />
    The Compton effect had been assessed by the Nobel Committee
    already in 1925 and 1926 and had found the theory very
    unsatisfactory. However, in 1927 that had changed. The new
    evaluation was carried out by Carl Wilhelm Oseen, professor of
    Mechanics and Mathematical Physics at Uppsala University. He did
    a thorough study for the Committee. He began by recalling the
    great interest by which Compton's discovery in 1922 had been met,
    much due to the theory offered by Compton himself. He writes
    <i>(my translation from Swedish)</i> "it is not surprising that
    the agreement of this theory with observations inspired with less
    critical representatives for theoretical physics the thought
    that, the lengthy fight between the wave theory and the
    corpuscular theory would be nearing its end. Compton's discovery
    was by these scientists taken as the decisive proof for the truth
    of the corpuscular theory. If these expectations had been
    fulfilled, the discovery by Compton would undoubtedly had marked
    a decisive turning point in the development of the whole of the
    radiation theory". Oseen set out to show that this is not so. His
    view was that the new effect, discovered by Compton, is
    nevertheless, very important.<br />
    <br />
    Oseen describes how the Bohr theory had fallen by 1925 and that
    the Compton effect had nothing to do with that. He mentions how
    matrix-mechanics and wave-mechanics have entered the stage
    without inspiration from the Compton effect. The oldest theories
    for the Compton effect were given by Compton, and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1936/index.html">'Debijes' (Debye)</a> and
    Woos. Being based on the theory of light quanta "they have been
    of value to experimental research, but must now be considered
    obsolete in view of the latest theories". Oseen mentions several
    such newer works, especially that by Gordon and a recent one by
    O. Klein, based on the wave theory, treating both electrons and
    light as waves. They all arrive at the same equations for the
    conservation of energy and momentum between the scattered wave
    and the recoiling electron as originally derived by Compton
    assuming a two-particle collision. "The basis for the
    Compton-Debije theory is thus found, this time not as a
    hypothesis but as a consequence of the atomic theory," is a
    conclusion by Oseen, which justifies his judgement of the former
    being obsolete. These wave mechanical treatments, furthermore,
    also gave formulae for the intensity vs scattering angle (i.e.
    differential cross section) in much better agreement with
    measurements than the classical wave theory prediction.<br />
    <br />
    Oseen summarised by saying that the revolution during the last 18
    months had been independent of Compton's discovery and that the
    new direction for the revolution had moved opposite to the one
    expected after Compton's discovery. The new theory is a wave
    theory in a higher degree than any previous theory. Using the new
    theory it has been possible to give a qualitatively and
    quantitatively correct account of the Compton effect.<br />
    <br />
    The Committee emphasised that the Compton effect is nevertheless
    important, since it once more and very clearly and convincingly
    demonstrates that the classical theories are not applicable in
    the realm of atomic physics and that it offers a valuable and
    welcome possibility to test the new ideas.</p>

  <h3>Prizes for the Discoveries of the Dual Nature of Matter</h3>

  <p>The dual nature of light has been extended
  to a similar duality in matter as well. Electrons and atoms were
  originally considered as corpuscles. In 1929 <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1929/index.html">Prince Louis-Victor de
  Broglie</a> was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for "his
  discovery of the wave nature of electrons". Experimental proofs
  were given by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1937/index.html">Clinton Joseph Davisson</a>,
  New York, and <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1937/index.html">Sir
  George Paget Thomson</a> from London. They were jointly awarded
  the Nobel Physics Prize in 1937. Ever since <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/index.html">Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger</a>
  in 1925 discovered the nonrelativistic wave equation for the
  electron wave mechanics has been a valuable tool for the natural
  sciences. Schr&ouml;dinger was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics
  in 1933.</p>

  <p>The Nobel Committee had earlier carefully
    avoided being explicit about the particle nature of light, but
    did not hesitate to be explicit about matter sometimes behaving
    as waves. Bohr's idea about complementarity had been presented
    two years earlier, so in the presentation speech at the Nobel
    award ceremony in 1929 one finds a reflection of that in the
    following sentences: "It thus seems that light is at once a wave
    motion and a stream of corpuscles. Some of its properties are
    explained by the former supposition, others by the second. Both
    must be true."</p>

  <h3>Nobel Prize for Theories Solving the Duality Problem of
  Light</h3>

  <p>With the advent of quantum mechanics in
  1925-1926 the possibility opened for a solution to the duality
  problem.<br />
  <br />
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/index.html">Paul Dirac</a>
  published in 1927 a mathematical theory for the interaction
  between electromagnetic fields, such as light or X-rays, and
  charged particles with both aspects of light inbedded - it was a
  theory of quantised fields. Further contributions were given by
  several physicists and was generalized also to matter fields and
  is today an indispensable tool for treating fundamental
  interactions of any kind (strong, weak or electromagnetic). Three
  of the pioneers, Dirac, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/index.html">Werner Heisenberg</a> and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1945/index.html">Wolfgang Pauli</a>,
  were awarded Nobel Prizes for Physics but for other
  achievements.<br />
  <br />
  The initial version of the Dirac theory combining wave and
  particle aspects of light, is useful only to a first
  approximation. Calculations give reasonable agreements with
  experiments; one such is the differential cross section for
  Compton scattering. However, when attempting more accurate
  calculations, which are needed in specific cases, the results
  become crazy and in fact infinite. The situation was remedied in
  the 1940s by works of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">Sin-Itiro Tomonaga</a>,
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">Julian Schwinger</a>
  and <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">Richard
  Feynman</a>, who were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics
  in 1965. Thanks to their work one now has one of the most
  beautiful and accurate theories mankind has achieved in this
  area, the QED or Quantum Electro-Dynamics. It is expressed in
  mathematical language, perfect for this kind of enterprise, going
  beyond the everyday dialectic of wave and particle duality to the
  synthesis of a quantum field.</p>

  <p>Richard Feynman based his version of
    quantum mechanics on the concept of "path integral". He proposed
    that the transition probability amplitude be calculated by
    summing contributions from each alternative space-time trajectory
    of the particles with specific phase factors. From this approach
    Feynman derived a graphical representation of the amplitudes of
    the QED, which made the theory much easier to handle. In Feynman
    graphs photons and electrons are pictorially given as lines in a
    space-time diagram. Interactions with exchange of energy-momentum
    and other properties occur in such space-time points, where
    particle lines meet. Feynman graphs are nowadays the standard
    method used to calculate theoretical predictions.<br />
    <br />
    The QED theory is, however, too advanced for many practical
    applications and usually given only as advanced graduate courses.
    Every new physics student therefore has to struggle with the
    duality problem, allowing the simultaneous existence of both
    particle and wave concepts and holding that the two are mutually
    exclusive (as Niels Bohr formulated in his Complementarity
    Principle of 1927).<br />
    <br />
    A small, elementary book based on popular lectures by Feynman,
    can be recommended: "QED. The Strange Theory of Light and Matter" by Richard
    Feynman (Princeton University Press, 1985), in which Feynman gives the essence
    of his version of QED in simple
    language and elegant manner, even describing how the laws of
    geometrical optics can be derived from the QED theory.</p>

  <h3>The Wave-Particle Duality in One and the Same Experiment</h3>

  <p>Experiments with beams of light or of
  electrons have been made such that both aspects - waves and
  particles - are observed. For interference to occur it is among
  other things also necessary for the beam to have available more
  than one path from source to detector (e.g. a screen).
  Interference is explained by the wave picture. When the beam
  intensity is sufficiently low and the detector suitable the
  impact of particles one by one can be observed. The energy quanta
  are then localised as if particles in space and time.</p>

  <h3>Postcript</h3>

  <p>The photon is the field quantum (particle)
  acting as the communicator of force between charged particles. It
  has successfully been imbedded in a larger context together with
  the three communicators of the weak force - (W<sup>+</sup>,
  W<sup>-</sup> Z<sup>0</sup>). The latter three are very heavy
  particles, whereas the photon is massless. Together they are the
  communicators of the forces of the unified electroweak
  interaction.<br />

  their contributions to the theory of the unified weak and
  electromagnetic interactions between elementary particles,
  including, inter alia, the prediction of the weak neutral
  current" and in 1984 to <a href=
