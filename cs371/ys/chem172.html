				  <p><a href="http://www.textrev.com/"><b>TextRev</b></a> is a free tool for instructors who wish to generate a customized Web-based survey for their course. The survey provides picture of how much time students spend each week using the textbook, CD-ROM, web site, solution manual, etc. It will also inform you of how helpful students find particular features of the text, e.g., images, sample problems, real-world examples. The site also post aggregative reviews of selected texts.</p>
