<h1>RJN's More Digits of Irrational Numbers Page</h1>

<p>

All digits accessible here were computed by Robert Nemiroff and
Jerry Bonnell on a VMS Alpha.  They are not copyrighted and we do
not think it is legally justifiable to copyright such a basic thing
as the digits of a commonly used irrational number.  To the best of
our knowledge, these are the most digits ever computed as of 1 July 
1994 for these numbers.  We do NOT guarantee the accuracy of these 
digits, although some of the digits have been checked, as noted.  We
welcome independent checks of these numbers.  We have made some of
these digits available through Project Gutenberg.

<p>

These digits are mainly of passing interest, but many people find them
interesting for many different reasons.  We use them as pseudo-random
numbers and encourage others to do this as well.  We have not found
any of the digits to possess any unexpected correlations, and welcome
attempts to check these digits for correlations.
