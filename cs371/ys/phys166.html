				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Andrei Linde is one of Yuri Milner&#8217;s $3 million dollar men, best known for his &#8220;chaotic inflation&#8221; version of inflationary theory, as well as being one of the main proponents of anthropic multiverse mania.  There&#8217;s a long piece based on a conversation with him up now at the <a href="http://edge.org/conversation/a-balloon-producing-balloons-producing-balloons-a-big-fractal-">Edge web-site</a>.</p>
<p>Much of the piece is just a retread of the usual heavily-promoted ideology of the past 30 years of fundamental physics research:  we must have SUSY, so must have supergravity, so must have string theory, so must have the landscape, so must have a multiverse where we can&#8217;t predict anything about anything, thus finally achieving success.  Linde claims he pretty much had this picture 30 years ago back in 1982, with the string theory component in 1986, with others coming around to his point of view in the last 10 years, partly because of the KKLT work he was co-author of in 2003.</p>
<p>Besides the tired Stanford pseudo-scientific ideology, there&#8217;s also a wonderful history of the subject of inflation, from a Moscow point of view, which is rather different than the Western, Alan Guth-oriented, point of view from which the story is often told.   Linde&#8217;s description of Hawking&#8217;s visit to Moscow is not to be missed:</p>
<blockquote><p> The next morning after I gave a talk at this conference, I found myself at the talk… oh, my God, this is going to be a funny story&#8230; I found myself at the talk by Stephen Hawking at Sternberg Institute of Astronomy in Moscow University. I came there by chance because I have heard from somebody that Hawking was giving a talk there. And they asked me to translate. I was surprised. Okay, I will do it. Usually at that time Stephen would give his talk well prepared, which means his student would deliver the talk, and Stephen from time to time would say something, and then the student would stop, and change his presentation and do something else. So Stephen Hawking would correct and guide the student. But in this case they were completely unprepared; the talk was about inflation. The talk was about the impossibility to improve Alan Guth&#8217;s inflationary theory.</p>
<p>So they were unprepared, they just finished their own paper on it. As a result, Stephen would say one word, his student would say one word, and then they waited until Stephen would say another word, and I would translate this word. And all of these people in the auditorium, the best scientists in Russia, were waiting, and asking what is going on, what it is all about? So I decided let&#8217;s just do it, because I knew what it&#8217;s all about. So Stephen would say one word, the student would say one word, and then after that I would talk for five minutes, explaining what they were trying to say.</p>
<p>For about a half an hour we were talking this way and explained to everyone why it was impossible to improve Alan Guth&#8217;s inflationary model, what are the problems with it. And then Stephen said something, and his students said: &#8220;Andrei Linde recently proposed a way to overcome this difficulty.” I didn&#8217;t expect it, and I happily translated it into Russian. And then Stephen said: &#8220;But this suggestion is wrong.&#8221; And I translated it… For half an hour I was translating what Stephen said, explaining in great detail why what I&#8217;m doing is totally wrong. And it was all happening in front of the best physicists in Moscow, and my future in physics depended on them. I&#8217;ve never been in a more embarrassing situation in my life.</p>
<p>Then the talk was over, and I said: “I translated, but I disagree,&#8221; and I explained why. And then I told Stephen: &#8220;Would you like me to explain it to you in greater detail?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; And then he rode out from this place, and we found some room, and for about two or three hours all the people in Sternberg Institute were in panic because the famous British scientist just disappeared, nobody knew where to.</p>
<p>During that time, I was near the blackboard, explaining what was going on there. From time to time, Stephen would say something, and his student would translate: “But you did not say that before.” Then I would continue, and Stephen would again say something, and his student would say again the same words: “But you did not say that before.” And after we finished, I jumped into his car and they brought me to their hotel. We continued the discussion, which ended by him showing me photographs of his family, and we became friends. He later invited me to a conference in Cambridge, in England, which was specifically dedicated to inflationary theory. So that&#8217;s how it all started. It was pretty dramatic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Addressing the question of &#8220;what evidence is there for any of this?&#8221;, here&#8217;s what Linde has to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Usually I answer in the following way: If we do not have this picture, then we cannot explain many strange coincidences, which occur around us. Like why vacuum energy is so immensely small, incredibly small. Well, that is because we have many different vacua, and in those vacua where vacuum energy is too large, galaxies cannot form. In those vacua, where energy density is negative, the universe rapidly collapses, and in our vacuum the energy density is just right, and that is why we live here. That&#8217;s the anthropic principle. But you cannot use anthropic principle if you do not have many possibilities to choose from. That&#8217;s why multiverse is so desirable, and that&#8217;s what I consider experimental evidence in favor of multiverse.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, the main experimental evidence for the multiverse is that an anthropic argument works.  Some might not find this completely convincing.</p>
<p>About 5 years ago, the field of &#8220;string cosmology&#8221; was quite active, with even a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-String-Cosmology-Maurizio-Gasperini/dp/0521868750">graduate-level textbook</a> appearing.  My impression (contrast the tone of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.2660">this review</a>, with those of 5 years earlier) is that there&#8217;s much less interest in this area during recent years, since it became obvious that no predictions about physics were going to emerge from it.  Late this year or early next year the Planck experiment will finally report what it sees in the CMB.  I&#8217;m curious to know whether Linde and other string cosmology proponents have any predictions for what Planck will tell us.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The Annenberg Foundation funds <a href="http://www.learner.org">Annenberg Learner</a>, a site designed to provide information to high school teachers.  Their <a href="http://www.learner.org/courses/physics">Physics</a> course includes a <a href="http://www.learner.org/courses/physics/unit/text.html?unit=4&#038;secNum=0">unit from Stanford&#8217;s Shamit Kachru</a>, which is pretty much pure hype, unadulterated by any skepticism that string theory might not be the way the world works.  Physicists may have lost interest in string cosmology, seeing it as a failure, but that&#8217;s no reason not to teach it to high school students&#8230;</p>

				<p>Bill Thurston passed away yesterday, at the age of 65, after a battle with melanoma.  Thurston was for many years the dominant figure in the study of 3 dimensional topology and geometry, winning a Fields medal for this work in 1982. His &#8220;Geometrization Conjecture&#8221; classifying the topology of 3 manifolds was finally proved by Perelman as part of his work on the Poincar&eacute; Conjecture.</p>
<p>For an exposition of some of his work, see <em>The Geometry and Topology of Three-manifolds</em>, which exists as a set of unpublished notes <a href="http://library.msri.org/books/gt3m/">here</a>, and a book covering the first few chapters of the notes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Three-Dimensional-Geometry-Topology-Vol-1/dp/0691083045">here</a>.  Thurston was sometimes criticized for not writing up full proofs of his results, making it difficult for others entering the field (and sometimes students were advised not to enter the field since Thurston was so good the danger was he would just solve all open problems).  He wrote a truly wonderful essay <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math.HO/9404236">On Proof and Progress in Mathematics</a>, responding to this and laying out part of his vision of how to do mathematics.</p>
<p>My first encounter with Thurston was in the early eighties, when I was a physics graduate student at Princeton.  I was working on the problem of defining the topological charge of a lattice gauge field, and it became clear that one approach to do this would require computing the volumes of &#8220;spherical tetrahedra&#8221;, the 3d analog of the problem of computing the areas of spherical triangles.  I&#8217;d had some experience trying to talk to mathematicians about the problem I was working on, with the usual result a baffling response about principal bundles, sections, characteristic classes, and all sorts of what seemed to be abstract nonsense (which later on of course I learned was the right way to think about the problem&#8230;).  So, I was pretty convinced that mathematicians were uniformly experts in a lot of abstract, high-powered technology, surely no longer conversant with the kind of more concrete formulas of the mathematics of earlier centuries.</p>
<p>This was before the days of the internet, so the answer to my problem couldn&#8217;t be found via Google, and a bit of library research got me nowhere.  So, I stopped by to see a friend who was a math grad student and asked him my volume question.  He said that while he didn&#8217;t know, he knew someone who could surely help me, and took me over to the math lounge, where Thurston could often be found.  After I asked my question, Thurston immediately knew the answer, explained it to me on the blackboard, and gave me the proper reference of where to read more (you break them up in a certain way and then get an answer in terms of things called Schl&auml;fli functions, see <a href="http://qjmath.oxfordjournals.org/content/os-6/1/13.full.pdf">here</a>).  I realized that my views of how much the best research mathematicians knew about concrete calculations and lore from previous centuries had been rather naive.</p>
<p>Thurston&#8217;s death at such a relatively young age is a loss for us all.  My condolences to his family, including his son Dylan, a very talented topologist in his own right, who has been my colleague here for the last several years.</p>

				<p>The LHC is operating well, hitting record peak luminosities, with integrated luminosity for the year over 11 fb<sup>-1</sup>.  By the end of the year there may be 25 fb<sup>-1</sup> per experiment or so.   Current plan seems to be to update the results on the Higgs in December, much like last year, so there may not be much news until then.  </p>
<p>This week the LHC Machine Advisory Committee was meeting, slides <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=198003">here</a>.  The current schedule has this proton run ending mid-December.  After a heavy-ion run early next year, the machine will go into a long shutdown starting in March, with main goal to fix the magnet interconnections and commission the machine to run at nearly design energy, 6.5 TeV/beam.  First beams at this energy will not be until April 2015, with maybe 20-25 fb<sup>-1</sup> of integrated luminosity in the first year&#8217;s run.</p>
<p>With no sign of SUSY so far, and little reason to believe it will show up in the rest of the 2012 data since nothing has shown up already, the rallying cry of SUSY enthusiasts is now &#8220;Wait Until 2015&#8243;, or, maybe more like 2016, since early 2016 may be when analyses of a significant amount of 6.5 TeV data start to appear.  I&#8217;d been wondering whether David Gross has been getting discouraged at the prospect of having to pay off on his SUSY bets.  Someone asked him this recently, with the results <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beGAv_GNAhU">here on YouTube</a>.  He says he&#8217;s still willing to take 50/50 bets on SUSY, but &#8220;with the right conditions&#8221;, which are 50 fb<sup>-1</sup> of analyzed data/experiment (he says this will be &#8220;years from now I think&#8221;, roughly 2017 maybe if all goes well), and he adds &#8220;then we need a judge, because it won&#8217;t be so obvious I think&#8221;.  So, it looks like it&#8217;s going to be quite a while before we get to see Gross pay up&#8230;</p>

				<p>This post was originally going to be just about the latest SUSY exclusion results announced at <a href="http://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/~susy2012/">SUSY 2012</a> and their significance, but I realized there&#8217;s nothing much new to say, and it would be tedious to just write the same things.  ATLAS new results are <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasPublic/SupersymmetryPublicResults">here</a>, including some using this year&#8217;s 8 TeV data. As before, not a hint of SUSY in the CMS or ATLAS data.  Now that the expected places to find SUSY have shown nothing, emphasis is on how to search more obscure corners of the 100 + parameter space of the theory which are accessible at the LHC, but hard to study.  For a good recent survey of this effort, see Matt Reece&#8217;s recent presentation <a href="http://kicp-workshops.uchicago.edu/IDM2012/depot/plenary-talk-reece-matthew__4.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>SUSY 2012 featured a plenary talk by Gordon Kane, promoting his string theory &#8220;predictions&#8221;.  As usual, the gluino is right around the corner.  Back in 2000, it was supposed to be around 250 GeV, with SUSY discovery at the Tevatron in 2001-3 (see <a href="http://particle-theory.physics.lsa.umich.edu/kane/SupersymmetryWhatWhyWhen.pdf">here</a>).  Last summer the &#8220;prediction&#8221; was 600 GeV, just above the 500 GeV limits. Last December, the gluino discovery was imminent, by summer 2012.   The <a href="http://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/~susy2012/resources/conf_day3/plenary/Gordy_Kane_China_Higgs.pdf">latest news</a> is that the gluino mass prediction is now 1 TeV, just above the 800 GeV limits according to Kane.  You can watch the gluino move by comparing the same &#8220;prediction&#8221; plot on slide 22 <a href="http://conferencing.uwex.edu/conferences/stringpheno2011/documents/kane.pdf">here</a> and slide 34 <a href="http://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/~susy2012/resources/conf_day3/plenary/Gordy_Kane_China_Higgs.pdf">here</a>.  Kane now claims in bold face that &#8220;<strong>String/M theory prediction is that no gluino signal expected so far</strong>&#8221; (page 35) referring (I think) to <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1963">this paper</a>, which seems to say nothing of the kind. This is just getting more and more bizarre.</p>
<p>Matt Strassler (described <a href="http://www.isciencetimes.com/articles/3650/20120810/beyond-god-particle-cern-scientists-search-new-world-susy-supersymmetry.htm">here</a> as &#8220;the chief US theoretician&#8221;) has rarely been critical of string theory hype (although he did in a <a href="http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/where-stands-supersymmetry-as-of-42012/#comment-10389">comment</a> refer to Kane&#8217;s claims as &#8220;garbage and propaganda&#8221;), preferring to see prominent blogging critics of string theory and SUSY hype as the bigger problem to deal with.  Today though he took a dramatic and rather admirable step, with a posting about string theory that starts off with:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;the theory’s been spectacularly over-hyped, and the community’s political control of high-energy physics in many U.S. physics departments has negatively impacted many scientific careers, including my own.</p></blockquote>
<p>He goes on to cast himself as a lonely moderate surrounded by two teams of extremists, arguing that</p>
<blockquote><p>it is high time the ball were grabbed by the referee and placed quietly in the middle of the field where it belongs.</p></blockquote>
<p>His refereed position in the middle of the field would have acknowledgement that &#8220;string theory cannot be tested at present, and that situation might continue for a very long time, perhaps centuries&#8221;, while lauding string theory for providing a range of important insights into other problems than unification.   This refereed position seems to me already pretty much the mainstream position of string theorists I know.  My problems with it are that it still allows the heavy promotion of a failed idea (string unification as &#8220;our best bet&#8221;, even if mysteriously &#8220;hard to test&#8221;), and the over-hype problem is also prevalent among discussion of string theory applications to other parts of physics.</p>
<p>Strassler gives an interesting example of how some ideas from string theory ended up providing inspiration for advances in amplitude calculations, although the main heros of the tale are the phenomenologists who have done the hard work behind these advances (see his exchange with the anonymous &#8220;dude&#8221; in the comments).</p>
<p>Oddly enough, what seems to have motivated Strassler to take this new public stand are the recent $3 million prizes awarded to his colleagues down the road at Princeton.  He devoted <a href="http://profmattstrassler.com/2012/08/09/reminder-to-readers/">this recent posting</a> to attacking me and <em>Nature News</em> for quoting me about the prizes, but ended up agreeing with some of my concerns, specifically:</p>
<blockquote><p>What upsets me is that there is a long, long list of deserving scientists, some of whom have received little recognition despite their important work, and some of whom could really use some research money and/or time off from teaching — and Milner overlooked them all&#8230;</p>
<p>Philanthrophy needs to be done with the consent and participation of the beneficiaries; otherwise it generally fails, and sometimes it causes complete disasters. For instance, you can completely destabilize an organization that is functioning well if you just hand one of its members a million dollar check without understanding the implications&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, as far as I can tell, the Milner prize is one thing our field didn’t really need. I can think of a few things we really do desperately need, at least in the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty clear where Strassler thinks the money should have gone:</p>
<blockquote><p>we have too many string theorists teaching at the top U.S. universities, and not enough theorists doing other aspects of high-energy physics, including Standard Model predictions&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>He explained in the earlier posting that he has been trying to raise private money for an LHC Institute, but that this has failed because of the recession.  I don&#8217;t know any details of this, but I do know that about five years ago he and Arkani-Hamed were proposing something like this to the NSF, with the two of them as co-directors.  This foundered not because of the recession but because reviewers didn&#8217;t much like the idea of giving a lot of new money to well-funded theorists at Princeton and Rutgers, largely to retool string theory groups into LHC phenomenology groups.</p>
<p>That proposal advertised the likelihood of discovery of SUSY or something equally dramatic about a year after first beams at the LHC, with a large group of theorists needed to sort out the &#8220;LHC Inverse Problem&#8221; of how one was going to figure out the underlying physics responsible for the confusing plethora of non-SM signals the LHC would be seeing.  Perhaps a reason for finding it hard to get funding for a theory LHC institute these days is not the recession, but the lack of any such advertised signal.   On the other hand, with $12 million of cash in their pockets now, the IAS theorists should be able to themselves privately fund the proposed Arkani-Hamed/Strassler center, if they still think this a good idea.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Gerard &rsquo;t Hooft in recent years has been pursuing some idiosyncratic ideas about quantum mechanics; for various versions of these, see papers like <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0105105">this</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0212095">this</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604008">this</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4926">this</a>.  His latest version is last month&#8217;s <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3612">Discreteness and Determinism in Superstrings</a>, which starts with cellular automata in 1+1 dimensions and somehow gets a quantized superstring out of it (there are also some comments about this on his web-site <a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/">here</a>).</p>
<p>Personally I find it difficult to get at all interested in this (for reasons I&#8217;ll try and explain in a moment), but those who are interested might like to know that &rsquo;t Hooft has taken to explaining himself and discussing things with his critics at a couple places on-line, including <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/32203/discreteness-and-determinism-in-superstrings">Physics StackExchange</a>, and Lubos Motl&#8217;s blog.   If you want to discuss &rsquo;t Hooft&#8217;s ideas, best if you use one of these other venues, where you can interact with the man himself.</p>
<p>One of &rsquo;t Hooft&#8217;s motivations is a very common one, discomfort with the non-determinism of the conventional interpretation of quantum mechanics.  The world is full of crackpots with similar feelings who produce reams of utter nonsense.  &rsquo;t Hooft is a scientist though of the highest caliber, and as with some other people who have tried to do this sort of thing, I don&#8217;t think what he is producing is nonsense.  It is, however, extremely speculative, and, to my taste, starting with a very unpromising starting point. </p>
<p>Looking at the results he has, there&#8217;s very little of modern physics there, including pretty much none of the standard model (which &rsquo;t Hooft himself had a crucial role in developing).  If you&#8217;re going to claim to solve open problems in modern physics with some radical new ideas, you need to first show that these ideas reproduce the successes of the estabished older ones.  From what I can tell, &#8216;t Hooft may be optimistic he can get there, but he&#8217;s a very long way from such a goal.</p>
<p>Another reason for taking very speculative ideas seriously, even if they haven&#8217;t gotten far yet, is if they seem to involve a set of powerful and promising ideas.  This is very much a matter of judgement: what to me are central and deep ideas about mathematics and physics are quite different than someone else&#8217;s list.   In this case, the central mathematical structures of quantum mechanics fit so well with central, deep and powerful insights into modern mathematics (through symmetries and representation theory) that any claim these should be abandoned in favor of something very different has a big hurdle to overcome.  Basing everything on cellular automata seems to me extremely unpromising: you&#8217;re throwing out deep and powerful structures for something very simple and easy to understand, but with little inherent explanatory power.  That&#8217;s my take on this, those who see this differently and want to learn more about what &rsquo;t Hooft is up to should follow the links above, and try discussing these matters at the venues &rsquo;t Hooft is frequenting.</p>

<li>The only thing stopping me so far from ordering a copy of Francis Farley&#8217;s novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Catalysed-Fusion-ebook/dp/B0084P6PAC">Catalysed Fusion</a> is that it looks like it is only available in ebook form, and I&#8217;ve until now avoided those and stuck to paper.

<blockquote><p>&#8230;a steamy new novel written by a retired physicist lifts the lid on the organisation&#8217;s studious exterior to reveal an altogether more glamorous lifestyle of wild nights, adrenalin-fuelled sports and romantic trysts&#8230;</p>
<p>Prof Farley describes a group of young researchers whose groundbreaking work and racy private lives intertwine as they enjoy the high life at Switzerland&#8217;s top ski resorts and France&#8217;s best beaches.</p>
<p>Prof Farley revealed that he even based a character on himself – Ivan, a physicist and crack glider pilot who is married to a former stripper and sets up a new lab on a nudist Mediterranean island.</p>
<p>He told the Daily Telegraph: &#8220;We were well paid, we had diplomatic status, no taxes. We got tax-free petrol and drinks and we went out and enjoyed life&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;We worked hard and then some people would go home to their families but there were lots of little floozies about and other men had a roving eye, and so did some of the women.&#8221;

<p>Perhaps things have changed a bit since the eighties in Geneva&#8230;.</li>
<li>Text books for graduate students on SUSY and string theory are coming fast and furious these days.  Next month will see Peter West&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Strings-Branes-Peter-West/dp/0521817471">Introduction to Strings and Branes</a>, a few months ago there was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/String-Theory-Particle-Physics-Phenomenology/dp/0521517524">String Theory and Particle Physics: An Introduction to String Phenomenology</a> by Ibanez and Uranga.

<blockquote><p>This is a must-buy for every high energy theorist who wants to know Sugra. The first nine chapters also make a great source for classical field theory and can be used as a complement for PhD students learning QFT and GR.<br />

				<p>For many years now discussion in the HEP community of what might be the appropriate next machine to try and finance and build after the LHC has centered around the idea of a linear electron-positron collider.   The logic has been that an electron-positron machine would provide a much better environment that the LHC for detailed studies of physics at the TeV scale.  At these energies, synchrotron radiation losses when accelerating electrons are so high in a circular geometry that such a machine would have to be a linear collider to keep the power needed something plausible.  The two main proposals under study have been the ILC (250 GeV + 250 GeV, later upgradeable to 500 GeV + 500 GeV) and, a less mature technology, CLIC (1.5 TeV + 1.5 TeV).  These would be very expensive machines to build and operate ($10 billion and up?), requiring completely new technology, tunnels and detectors.</p>
<p>The operating assumption has been that initial results from the LHC would show the existence of new supersymmetric or other particle states in the region of multiple hundreds of GeV to small numbers of TeV, and the linear collider designs could then be chosen and optimized to study this new physics.  The other main goal of such a collider would be detailed study of the Higgs, and knowing the mass of the Higgs is also highly relevant to what kind of linear collider to build.</p>
<p>The initial LHC results are now in (125 GeV Higgs, nothing new at the TeV scale) and they are rather discouraging for the linear collider idea, providing no strong motivation for studying electron-positron collisions around 1 TeV.  A &#8220;Higgs Factory&#8221; capable of producing and studying large numbers of Higgs particles is an attractive idea, but the production cross-section for a 125 GeV Higgs is dominated by the process e<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> -> Z + H, which starts to get large around 220 GeV and reaches a maximum value around 255 GeV.   So, for most Higgs studies, the right energy for an electron-positron machine is around 250 GeV, not 1 TeV.</p>
<p>This realization is driving a new proposal that is getting a lot of attention:  the idea of going back to circular electron-positron colliders, building a new machine in the LHC tunnel, optimized as a Higgs factory, and designed to operate at 120 GeV + 120 GeV.  This is being called &#8220;LEP3&#8243;, since it would be in many ways similar to LEP2, the predecessor machine to the LHC, which operated in the same tunnel, reaching an energy of 209 GeV.   There would be huge cost advantages to building such a machine over the ILC or CLIC, since it can use the LHC tunnel, infrastructure, and, crucially, the CMS and ATLAS detectors (the detectors are a large part of the cost of a new accelerator).</p>
<p>Space was left in the LHC tunnel to allow another ring, so there are various possibilities for having a LEP3 and the LHC cohabitate. Until now, the assumption has been that the LHC would be upgraded to the&#8221;HL-LHC&#8221;, operating at higher luminosity throughout the 2020s, then perhaps an &#8220;HE-LHC&#8221;, operating at higher energies during the 2030s.  This plan is being challenged by the LEP3 proposal, with the argument that it might turn out that Higgs physics is where the only action will be, and a long period of LHC operation at higher luminosities and modestly higher energies might be less worthwhile than building a LEP3 Higgs factory.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a very good article about this at <a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2012/aug/06/physicists-unveil-plans-for-lep3-collider-at-cern">PhysicsWorld</a>.  For more detail about LEP3, see <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=193791">here</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0504">here</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1662">here</a>.  John Ellis is one of the co-authors of the latest document proposing study of the LEP3 possibility, and the Physics World article has him arguing that, after waiting to see if LHC14 turns up anything:</p>
<blockquote><p>LEP3 could be a more secure option than the ILC if only a Higgs is discovered&#8230;If the LHC does not discover anything beyond the Higgs, then would you keep running it for years?</p></blockquote>
<p>Lyn Evans, who led construction of the LHC and is now director of the linear-collider project argues against the LEP3 concept:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first job is to fully exploit the LHC and all its upgrades, This is at least a 20 year programme of work, so I think that it is very unlikely that the LHC will be ripped out and replaced by a very modest machine with little scope apart from studying the Higgs.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem is, what if, as seems increasingly likely, &#8220;studying the Higgs&#8221; is the only new physics accessible in these energy ranges?  Dreams of superpartners and extra dimensions may die hard.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Around the time of the Higgs discovery announcement last month I was contacted by someone from the Italian left-wing newspaper <em>Il Manifesto</em>, who asked if I&#8217;d write something for them about the Higgs.   I told them that it would be much better if they could get an experimentalist to write about that topic, since the discovery was really an experimental achievement.  They managed to get Tommaso Dorigo to write that piece for them (see <a href="http://www.science20.com/quantum_diaries_survivor/my_two_pieces_higgs-91817">here</a>), but I agreed to write something for them a bit later, about the significance of other results from the LHC.  That piece <a href="http://www.ilmanifesto.it/area-abbonati/ricerca/nocache/1/manip2n1/20120807/manip2pg/11/manip2pz/326929/manip2r1/woit/">appeared in the newspaper today</a> in Italian translation, an English version follows here.</p>
<p>This was written last week, under the combined influence of watching some of the Strings 2012 talks and thinking about the possible impact of the new $3 million Fundamental Physics Prizes, which largely went to string theorists.  For this venue, I was unable to resist channeling my inner leftist (normally the only newspaper that wants me to write for them is the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>&#8230;) and making Russian financier Yuri Milner to a large extent the bogeyman of the piece.  </p>
<p>A very serious concern that I wanted to raise is that of the long-term danger that fundamental physics faces in the combination of string theory ideology and the possible &#8220;nightmare scenario&#8221; of the LHC finding nothing that disagrees with the Standard Model.   For decades now the theoretical side of the subject has been dominated by one specific set of not very compelling ideas: 10d superstrings at the Planck scale, with a SUSY GUT at slightly lower scale, and low-energy SUSY explaining the supposed &#8220;hierarchy problem&#8221; created by the vast difference between those scales and the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking (of order 100 GeV).  The force most likely to challenge the hegemony of this ideology has always been the LHC, which was supposed to see superpartners responsible for stabilizing the electroweak scale.   Watching the speakers at Strings 2012 made clear that the failure of this experimental prediction would not cause them to give up on this ideology, but instead to redouble efforts to prop it up at all costs.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem is the deeply entrenched nature of string theory ideology in the power centers of the academy and among the most talented theorists.  Milner&#8217;s choice to provide out-scale rewards to such talented people is not the main problem, although he provided a convenient target for me in the piece.  If we really do end up with the &#8220;nightmare scenario&#8221; of experiment not coming to rescue, it&#8217;s now all too clear where we end up: the textbooks of string theory and supersymmetry have already been written, and that will be codified as humanity&#8217;s best understanding of fundamental physical reality for the indefinite future.</p>
<p>Maybe some new theoretical ideas will somehow bloom, but otherwise our best hope to get out of this will be the efforts and innovations of talented experimentalists, likely requiring expensive equipment.  It will be a challenge to continue to find public resources to fund this.  Maybe if the trends of recent decades continue, it will be up to the financiers to decide whether humanity continues down the experimental path.  Luckily, a lot of them seem to be interested in physics.</p>
<p>The article follows, you might want to skip it if you&#8217;re a regular blog reader here, since you won&#8217;t hear anything new and it&#8217;s a bit of a rant&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Last month came an announcement from Geneva that physicists of my generation had been anxiously awaiting since our student days nearly<br />
forty years ago.  Experimentalist Tommaso Dorigo wrote in this newspaper about the great achievement of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and his 6000 or so colleagues, who came together to produce and make the first measurements of a new fundamental element of nature: the Higgs particle.</p>
<p>For theorists like myself, this was a bittersweet victory for our subject. The Higgs particle showed up more or less exactly in the manner predicted by the so-called Standard Model, a wildly successful fundamental quantum theory developed between 1967 and 1973.  This theory had passed critical tests time and time again, but until last month the trickiest part of the theory had not been tested by direct observation.  Perhaps we were missing something important, and the real world would slap us in the face with results contradicting the theory, and giving us clues about how to find a better one.  Instead, we saw the equations of our textbooks dramatically confirmed.  We now await a long process of detailed investigation of this new phenomenon, a process which will keep Tommaso and his colleagues busy for many years to come.</p>
<p>The Higgs discovery emerged as a single sudden announcement, but over the last two years an equally important discovery has slowly come into focus, one small piece of data from the LHC at a time.  Unlike the case of the Higgs, this discovery has been a vigorous slap in the face to the theoretical particle physics community, telling us in no uncertain terms that we&#8217;ve been wasting most of our time for the past thirty years.  For these three decades, the subject has been dominated by research into an elaborate speculative scenario which has been investigated in exhaustive detail.</p>
<p>This scenario goes under the name of &#8220;superstring theory&#8221;, referring to a set of ideas that form not exactly a well-defined theory, but rather a conjecture that a theory with certain properties should exist. This theory would unify the Standard Model with Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity known as General Relativity, embedding both in a complicated structure involving six extra dimensions of space.  The possibility that these new dimensions would put in an appearance at the LHC has often been used to impress the public with flashy claims about the dramatic things that CERN&#8217;s new machine could find, things that sounded like (and were) science-fiction. Whatever they told the public, few physicists were expecting such dimensions to be observable in the data, since the conventional speculative scenario put their size at far too small a value to be seen at the LHC. No one has been surprised at all by the failure of any sign of extra dimensions to show up at CERN, despite a careful search for any possible evidence.</p>
<p>The &#8220;super&#8221; in &#8220;superstring&#8221; though is a different story.  This indicates a crucial property of the conjectural unifying theory: each fundamental particle should come paired with another one of very specific properties, the particle&#8217;s &#8220;superpartner&#8221;.  The electron should be paired with a new particle named the &#8220;selectron&#8221;, each quark with a &#8220;squark&#8221;, etc.  Over the years an increasingly rigid ideology explaining the supposedly wondrous properties of this &#8220;supersymmetry&#8221; which would dramatically improve upon the Standard Model.  That supersymmetry provided none of the powerful explanations of past observations we have come to expect from new symmetry principles was an inconvenient issue best ignored.  As each new generation of accelerators came to life at CERN and at Fermilab in the United States,  superpartners were looked for, but never found.</p>
<p>Supersymmetry entered the textbooks anyway and has now been taught to generations of graduate students.  Always part of the story being told was the claim that superpartners should have masses roughly similar to the mass of the Higgs particle.  When the Higgs was found, the superpartners had to be there too.  Consistency of the Standard Model demanded that the Higgs could not be too massive, so long before the LHC was turned on, it was a sure thing that if the Higgs particle was there the LHC would find it.  That part of the story worked out perfectly, but it has been accompanied by a huge embarrassment: no sign of any superpartners at all.  Not only were they supposed to be not too much heavier than the Higgs, but many of them were supposed to be much produced much more copiously, and thus be much easier to see.  By now the LHC experiments have shown that such expected particles are absent, unless they are made inaccessible by pushing their masses up to more than an order of magnitude higher than that of the Higgs, a value far beyond what had been advertised as reasonable.</p>
<p>The implications of this attack on theorists by the reality principle are just beginning to sink in. The big yearly conference of superstring theorists was held this past week in Munich, with different speakers taking different approaches to dealing with the problem.  One speaker advocated not doing anything until next year, hoping against hope that  newer data would give better results.  Others took the attitude that it had been clear for quite a while that superstring theory wasn&#8217;t going to show signs of existence at the LHC, so best to just work on finding other uses for it.  In the conference final &#8220;Outlook and Vision&#8221; talk, the illustrious speaker announced that all was well, and didn&#8217;t mention the LHC results at all.  The ostrich-like tactic of burying one&#8217;s head in the sand seems to be on the agenda for now, but this will become increasingly difficult to maintain as time goes on and more and more conclusive negative experimental results arrive.</p>
<p>As a physicist, one problem with having an experiment tell you that your ideas are wrong is that it means you are ineligible for a Nobel Prize.  Your hopes for a right to a part share in $1.2 million have been dashed, and, no matter how famous and well-paid an academic star you may be, you will have to content yourself with living on your salary, supplemented perhaps by smaller, less well-known consolation prizes.</p>
<p>Around the time of the end of the superstring theory conference though, dramatic news came from billionaire Russian financier Yuri Milner.  Known for building the most expensive house in the United States, he decided to help support physics by depositing $3 million dollars per person in the bank accounts of 8 prominent physicists and one mathematician, rewarding 6 of them for their work in superstring theory.  He has modeled himself after Alfred Nobel, announcing a new foundation that will give out Fundamental Physics Prizes each year.  Unlike the Nobel, these prizes can go to work for which there is no experimental evidence.  What he&#8217;s looking for are &#8220;transformative advances&#8221; like superstring theory, which have gotten the seal of approval of popularity among high-status academics. Even if experiment shows the ideas to be wrong, as in the case of the latest data about supersymmetry, that doesn&#8217;t matter.  What does matter is that the recipients should reflect the conventional wisdom in the academy. The choice of who to give the Prizes to included  giving them to every single professor of particle physics at the world&#8217;s most prestigious academic institution, the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.  The question of competition with the Nobel prize was dealt with by setting the value of the prize far above that of the Nobel, at a level significantly higher than any other academic prize in the world.</p>
<p>The slap in the face by experimental data and its threat to impose the  reality principle on the most powerful figures in the world of theoretical physics has thus been met by a riposte from another powerful force. This is another reality, that of entrenched academic interests, funded by the billions of dollars available to financiers who want to impose their will upon the world, or at least the small part of it that will write the textbooks of the future.  Which of these forces will carry the day?  Will the budget cuts imposed on physics research in Italy and elsewhere cripple the ability of the LHC experiments to continue to reveal the structure of nature, leaving our future fundamental science in the hands of powerful interests who will decide which version of reality they like best?</p>
<p>In the longer term, the physics community now faces difficult choices.  Any machine more powerful than the LHC will be expensive and require multiple decades to design, finance, build and operate.  The temptation will be there to again promise discovery of exotic new dimensions and supersymmetries in order to convince governments to provide funding.  Instead of such empty promises, physicists should just make the case that humanity deserves the chance to continue the experimental investigation of the fundamentals of physical reality.  The alternative is all too clear: the lack of public money to fund experimental investigation will put those with private money in charge of deciding what our scientific reality will be.</p></blockquote>

				<p>I&#8217;ve checked the date on this, and it&#8217;s not April 1, so maybe this is actually true.   According to the website of the Russian television news network RT, <a href="http://rt.com/art-and-culture/news/hollywood-mathematician-grigory-perelman-720">James Cameron to produce story of reclusive Russian genius</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Celebrated Russian mathematician Grigory Perelman, the man who solved a century-old problem then turned down a $1 million prize, is to be the subject of a Hollywood movie produced by James Cameron.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Perelman has made several breakthroughs in mathematics, geometry and topology. And though Perelman is known for leading a secluded life and avoiding journalists, he agreed to participate in the project dedicated to his milestone achievements. Avatar and Titanic creator James Cameron is rumored to be producing the movie.</p>
<p>Israeli producer Aleksandr Zabrovsky told KP Daily that it took him three years to convince Perelman to sign on to the project. He then approached Cameron with the idea, who was reportedly enthusiastic about it.</p>
<p>The film is due to be shot in the US, with an as-yet-unnamed professional actor covering the role of Perelman.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m finding it hard to figure out how Hollywood will dramatize the story of reclusively thinking about the Ricci-flow equations for seven years or so.  I guess it will all be in the special effects, for which Cameron is famous.</p>
<p>One should perhaps take this with a large grain of salt, considering the following (from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman">Wikipedia Perelman entry</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>In April 2011 Aleksandr Zabrovsky, producer of &#8220;President-Film&#8221; studio, claimed to have held an interview with Perelman and agreed to shoot a film about him, under the tentative title The Formula of the Universe.[36] Zabrovsky says that in the interview,[37] Perelman explained why he rejected the one million dollar prize.[36]</p>
<p>A number of journalists[38][39][40] believe that Zabrovky&#8217;s interview is most likely a fake, pointing to contradictions in statements supposedly made by Perelman.</p></blockquote>
