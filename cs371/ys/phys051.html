     <em>For
     your viewing pleasure, and perhaps for your educational
     pleasure, I've included some physics limericks here. Some
     are funny. Some are stupid. But at least they are all physically
     accurate (give or take). Many of them can be found scattered
     throughout the <a href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~djmorin/book.html">textbook</a> for
  the Physics-16 course here at Harvard. (Some more physics humor is located <a href="http://www.physics.harvard.edu/academics/undergrad/chickenroad.html">here</a>.)
     </em>
     <p><a href="/people/facpages/morin.html">&mdash; David
     Morin</a></p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt="" />
 <p> No pain, no gain. Alas, there
     are no shortcuts to learning physics... <br />
          <br />
          <span class="limericks">The
   ad said, for one little fee,<br />
  You can skip all that course-work ennui.<br />
    </span><span class="limericks"> So send your tuition,<br />
    For boundless fruition!<br />
  Get your mail-order physics degree! </span></p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> Always
     check your units! </p>
 <p class="limericks"> Your
     units are wrong! cried the teacher.<br />
  Your church weighs six joules &mdash; what a feature!<br />
  And the people inside<br />
  Are four hours wide,<br />
  And eight gauss away from the preacher! </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> And check
     the limiting cases, too! </p>
 <p class="limericks"> The
     lemmings get set for their race.<br />
  With one step and two steps they pace.<br />
  They take three and four,<br />
  And then head on for more, <br />
  Without checking the limiting case. </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p class="MsoNormal"> When converting
     the units of a quantity, all you have to do is multiply
     by 1 in an appropriately chosen form. For example, in converting
     minutes to seconds, just multiply 1min by 60s/1min (which
     equals 1), to obtain 1min=(1min)(60s/1min)=60s. The minutes
     cancel, and you're left with seconds. Of course, you could
     also multiply by 1 in the form of (1min/60s) to obtain 1min=(1min)(1min/60s)=1min<sup>2</sup>/60s.
     This does indeed equal 1 minute, but no one would know what
     you were talking about if you said you could run a 1min<sup>2</sup>/10s
     mile. </p>
 <p class="limericks">To
     figure the inches you&rsquo;ve run,<br />
  Or to find the slug mass of the sun,<br />
  Forget your aversion<br />
  To unit conversion.<br />
  Just multiply (wisely!) by 1. </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> People
     tend to rely a bit too much on computers and calculators
     nowadays, without pausing to think about what is actually
     going on in a problem. </p>
 <p class="limericks"> The
     skill to do math on a page<br />
  Has declined to the point of outrage.<br />
  Equations quadratica<br />
  Are solved on Math'matica,<br />
  And on birthdays
  we don't know our age. </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p class="MsoNormal"> Enrico Fermi
     was known for his ability to estimate things quickly and
     produce an order-of-magnitude guess with only minimal calculation.
     Hence, a problem where the goal is to simply obtain the
     nearest power-of-10 estimate is known as a &quot;Fermi problem&quot;.
     Of course, sometimes in life you need to know things to
     better accuracy than the nearest power of 10... </p>
 <p class="limericks">How
     Fermi could estimate things!<br />
  Like the well-known Olympic ten rings,<br />
  And the one-hundred states,<br />
  And weeks with ten dates,<br />
  And birds that all fly with one... wings. </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> Newton's
     first law, &quot;A body moves with constant velocity (which may
     be zero) unless acted on by a force,&quot; appears at first glance
     to be rather vacuous. In the words of Sir Arthur Stanley
     Eddington, it says that &quot;every particle continues in its
     state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line except
     insofar that it doesn't.&quot; But the first law actually does
     have some content. In particular, it gives a definition
     of an &quot;inertial frame&quot; (which is defined to be one in which
     the first law holds). This inertial frame is then used as
     the setting for Newton's second law. </p>
 <p class="limericks"> For
     things moving free or at rest,<br />
  Observe what the first law does best.<br />
  It defines a key frame,<br />
  Inertial by name,<br />
  Where the second law then is expressed. </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> Atwood's machines can be pretty
     hairy. But no matter how complicated they get, there are
     only two things you need to do to solve them: (1) Write
     down the <em>F=ma</em> equations for all the masses (which
     may involve relating the tensions in various strings), and
     (2) relate the accelerations of the masses, using the fact
     that the lengths of the various strings don't change (also
     known as &quot;conservation of string&quot;).<br />
        <br />
        <span class="limericks">It may seem, with the angst it
        can bring,<br />
  That an Atwood's machine's a harsh thing.<br />
  But you just need to say<br />
  That <em>F</em> is <em>ma</em>,<br />
  And use conservation of string! </span> </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> Galileo's
     experiment worked because the air is sufficiently thin.
     Who knows what he would have concluded if we lived in a
     thicker medium... </p>
 <p class="limericks"> What
     would you have thought, Galileo,<br />
  If instead you dropped cows and did say, &quot;Oh!<br />
  To lessen the sound<br />
  Of the moos from the ground,<br />
  They should fall not through air but through mayo!&quot; </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> The classic example of the independence
     of the <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-motions in projective motion
     is the &quot;hunter and monkey&quot; problem. In it, a hunter aims
     an arrow at a monkey hanging from a branch in a tree. The
     monkey, thinking he's being clever, tries to avoid the arrow
     by letting go of the branch right when he sees the arrow
     released. The unfortunate consequence of this action is
     that he <em>will</em> get hit, because gravity acts on both
     him and the arrow in the same way; they both fall the same
     distance relative to where they would have been if there
     were no gravity. And the monkey <em>would</em> get hit in
     such a case, because the arrow is initially aimed at him.<br />
        <br />
        <span class="limericks">If a monkey lets go of a tree,<br />
  The arrow will hit him, you see,<br />
  Because both heights are pared<br />
  By a half <em>gt</em><sup>2</sup><br />
  From what they would be with no <em>g</em>. </span> </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> Induction
     is a wonderful tool, but it shouldn't be abused...<br />
          <br />
           <span class="limericks">&quot;To three, five, and seven,
           assign<br />
           A name,&quot; the prof said, &quot;we'll define.&quot;<br />
  But he botched the instruction<br />
  With woeful induction,<br />
  And told us the next prime was nine. </span> </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> What really
     happened on that hill... </p>
 <p> <span class="limericks">In
     Boston, lived Jack, as did Jill,<br />
  Who gained <em>mgh</em> on a hill.<br />
  In their liquid pursuit, <br />
  Jill exclaimed with a hoot,<br />
&quot; I think we've just climbed a landfill!&quot; </span></p>
 <p class="limericks"> While
     noting, &quot;Oh, this is just grand,&quot;<br />
  Jack tripped on some trash in the sand.<br />
  He changed his potential<br />
  To kinetic, torrential,<br />
  But not before grabbing Jill's hand. </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> Newton's
     law of gravitation holds over a vast range of distance scales.
     Apples, moons, and stars all behave in the same manner,
     dependent on the <em>1/r</em> form of the gravitational potential. </p>
 <p class="limericks"> Newton
     said as he gazed off afar,<br />
&quot;From here to the most distant star,<br />
  These wond'rous ellipses<br />
  And solar eclipses<br />
  All come from a 1 over <em>r</em>.&quot; </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> The realization
     was nice, but then it took him another 20 years to develop
     calculus so that he could prove it mathematically. </p>
 <p class="limericks"> Newton
     looked at the data, numerical,<br />
  And then observations, empirical.<br />
  He said, &quot;But, of course,<br />
  We get the same force<br />
  From a point mass and something that's spherical!&quot; </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> Rockets
     make use of conservation of momentum, by ejecting small
     particles with very large speed. You never know when this
     technique might come in handy. </p>
 <p class="limericks"> Roger
     Clemens was stuck on a lake,<br />
  With no wind, oars, or fuel &mdash; big mistake!<br />
  So he thought like a rocket, <br />
  And emptied his pocket,<br />
  And left all his change in his wake. </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> It's no
     coincidence that physicists study the harmonic-oscillator
     potential, <em>kx</em><sup>2</sup><em>/2</em>, so much. A quick
     application of&nbsp; the Taylor-series expansion shows that <em>any</em> potential
     looks basically like a quadratic, if you look at a small
     enough region around an equilibrium point. </p>
 <p class="limericks"> A
     potential may look quite erratic,<br />
  And its study may seem problematic.<br />
  But down near a min,<br />
  You can say with a grin,<br />
&quot;It behaves like a simple quadratic!&quot; </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> Given
     a sufficiently long lever-arm, you can produce an arbitrarily
     large torque. This fact led a well-known mathematician from
     long ago to claim that he could move the earth if given
     a long enough lever-arm.<br />
          <br />
           <span class="limericks">One morning while eating my Wheaties,<br />
  I felt the earth move 'neath my feeties.<br />
  The cause for alarm<br />
  Was a long lever-arm,<br />
  At the end of which grinned Archimedes. </span> </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> On a rotating
     platform, the Coriolis force always points in the same direction
     relative to the direction of motion. Whether it's to the
     left or to the right depends on the direction of rotation.
     But given <em>w</em>  ,
     you're stuck with one or the other. </p>
 <p class="limericks"> On
     a merry-go-round in the night,<br />
  Coriolis was shaken with fright.<br />
  Despite how he walked,<br />

 <p> The kinetic energy of a body
     can be found by treating the body as a point mass located
     at the CM, and then adding on the kinetic energy of the
     body due to the motion relative to the CM.<br />
        <br />
         <span class="limericks">To calculate <em>E</em>, my dear

 <p><font face="Symbol">t</font>  =<em>dL/dt</em> is

     calculated) satisfies one of the following conditions: (1)
     The origin is the center of mass, (2) The origin is not
     accelerating, or (3) The acceleration the origin is parallel
     to the vector from the origin to the center of mass. This
     third condition is rarely invoked. So, when choosing an
     origin, just play it safe and heed the following... </p>
 <p class="limericks">For conditions

 <p> If a force is always applied
     at the same position relative to the origin around which
     the angular momentum is calculated (as in the case for a
     quick blow to an object), then <font face="Symbol">D</font>  L
     is proportional to  <font face="Symbol">D</font>  p,
     with the constant of proportionality being the lever-arm
     of the force. Even if we don't know what <font face="Symbol">D</font>  L
     and <font face="Symbol">D</font> p
     are, we know what their ratio is. </p>
 <p class="limericks">What <em>L</em> was,
     he just couldn't tell.<br />
  And <em>p</em>? He was clueless as well.<br />
  But despite his distress,<br />
  He wrote down the right guess<br />
  For their quotient: the lever-arm's <em>l</em>. </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> When studying
     central forces, conservation of angular momentum is utilized
     to write the angular dependence in terms of the radius,
     thereby reducing the problem to an ordinary 1-dimensional
     one, with a modified &quot;effective&quot; potential. </p>
 <p class="limericks"> When using potentials, effective,<br />
  Remember the one main objective:<br />
  The goal is to shun<br />
  All dimensions but one,<br />
  And then view things with 1-D perspective. </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> The <em>L</em><sup>2</sup>/2<em>mr</em><sup>2</sup> term
     in the effective potential is sometimes called the <em>angular
     momentum barrier</em>. It has the effect of keeping the particle
     from getting too close to the origin.  </p>

 <p> When solving
     an <em>F=ma</em> differential equation, sometimes you want
     to write <em>a</em> as <em>dv/dt</em>, and sometimes you want
     to write it as <em> v dv/dx</em>.
     One of these generally works much better than the other. </p>
 <p class="limericks"> <em>a</em> is <em>dv</em> by <em>dt</em>.<br />
  Is this useful? There's no guarantee.<br />
  If it leads to, &quot;Oh, heck!&quot;'s,<br />
  Take <em>dv</em> by <em>dx</em>,<br />
  And then write down its product with <em>v</em>. </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> Linear
     differential equations have the extremely important property
     that the sum of two solutions is also a solution. </p>
 <p class="limericks"> For
     equations with one main condition<br />
  (Those linear), we give you permission<br />
  To take you solutions,<br />
  With firm resolutions,<br />

 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> The standard
     method for solving differential equations is to simply guess
     an exponential solution. It may seem cheap, but it works. </p>
 <p class="limericks"> This
     is our method, essential,<br />

 <p> The minimal-action
     (more precisely, the stationary-action) method for solving
     problems yields all the same results as the standard <em>F=ma</em> method,
     but it avoids the use of force. You simply have to write
     down the difference between the kinetic and potential energies,
     and then take some derivatives. In many cases, writing down
     these energies (which are scalars) proves to be much simpler
     than trying to write down all the forces (which are vectors),
     which may be pointing in all sorts of complicated directions. </p>
 <p class="limericks"> It
     just stood there and did nothing, of course,<br />

 <p> The Euler-Lagrange equations
     in verse: </p>

     from high in a tree,<br />
  Just write down del L by del <em>z</em>.<br />
  Take del L by <em>z</em> dot,<br />
  Then <em>t</em>-dot what you've got,<br />
  And equate the results (but quickly!) </p>
 <img src="/img/auxil/bar.jpg" alt=""  />
 <p> It is sometimes said that nature
     has a &quot;purpose,&quot; in that it seeks to take the path that
     produces the minimum action. In fact, nature does exactly
     the opposite. It takes <em>every</em> path, treating them
     all on equal footing. We simply end up seeing the path with
     a stationary action, due to the way the quantum mechanical
     phases add.<br />
        <br />
  When an archer shoots an arrow through the air, the aim is
  made possible by all the other arrows taking all the other
  nearby paths, each with essentially the same action. Likewise,
  when you walk down the street with a certain destination in
  mind, you're not alone.<br />

 <p> The concept
     of the &quot;relativistic mass&quot;,  <font face="Symbol">g</font> <em>m</em>,
     is an unfortunate one. The goal, apparently, of such a definition
     is to have a relativistic particle of mass <em>m</em> behave
     exactly like a Newtonian particle of mass   <font face="Symbol">g</font>  <em>m</em>.
     This goal, however, is futile. A quick look at <em>F=dp/dt</em> shows
     why. For a transverse force, you can show that <em>F=</em>(<font face="Symbol">g</font> <em>m</em>)<em>a</em>,
     which does take the desired form. But for a longitudinal
     force, it turns out that <em>F=</em>(<font face="Symbol">g</font><sup>3</sup><em>m</em>)<em>a</em>,

     a more correct theory. That's how science works. You can't
