<p><span class="italic">Reviews of Modern Physics (RMP)</span> serves both students and senior researchers in a broad range of fields. Its review articles offer in-depth treatment of a research area, surveying recent work and providing an introduction that is aimed at physics graduate students and nonspecialists. These reviews also feature bibliographies that are of great value to the specialist. The journal's shorter Colloquia describe recent work of interest to all physicists, especially work at the frontiers of physics, which may have an impact on several different subfields.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/about">More...</a></p>

Initiated in 2008, the highly selective Outstanding Referee program recognizes scientists who have been exceptionally helpful in assessing manuscripts for publication in the APS journals. Selections are based on two decades of records on the number, quality, and timeliness of referee reports. The 2012 honorees come from 31 different countries, with large contingents from the US, Germany, UK, Canada, and France. The decisions were difficult and there are many excellent referees who have yet to be recognized. By means of the program, APS expresses appreciation to all referees, whose efforts in peer review not only keep the standards of the journals at a high level, but in many cases also help authors to improve the quality and readability of their articles—even those that are not published by APS. For more information and a sortable listing of all Outstanding Referees, please visit <a href="http://publish.aps.org/OutstandingReferees ">http://publish.aps.org/OutstandingReferees</a>.</p></div>

<div class = "feed-description"><p>The field of laser-matter interaction traditionally deals with the response of atoms, molecules, and plasmas to an external light wave. However, the recent sustained technological progress is opening up the possibility of employing intense laser radiation to trigger or substantially influence physical processes beyond atomic-physics energy scales. Available optical laser intensities exceeding <span>10<sup>22</sup>  W/cm<sup>2</sup></span> can push the fundamental light-electron interaction to the extreme limit where radiation-reaction effects dominate the electron dynamics, can shed light on the structure of the quantum vacuum, and can trigger the creation of particles such as electrons, muons, and pions and their corresponding antiparticles. Also, novel sources of intense coherent high-energy photons and laser-based particle colliders can pave the way to nuclear quantum optics and may even allow for the potential discovery of new particles beyond the standard model. These are the main topics of this article, which is devoted to a review of recent investigations on high-energy processes within the realm of relativistic quantum dynamics, quantum electrodynamics, and nuclear and particle physics, occurring in extremely intense laser fields.</p></div>

<div class = "feed-creator">Valeri N. Kotov, Bruno Uchoa, Vitor M. Pereira, F. Guinea, and A. H. Castro Neto</div>
<div class = "feed-description"><p>The problem of electron-electron interactions in graphene is reviewed. Starting from the screening of long-range interactions in these systems, the existence of an emerging Dirac liquid of Lorentz invariant quasiparticles in the weak-coupling regime is discussed, as well as the formation of strongly correlated electronic states in the strong-coupling regime. The analogy and connections between the many-body problem and the Coulomb impurity problem are also analyzed. The problem of the magnetic instability and Kondo effect of impurities and/or adatoms in graphene is also discussed in analogy with classical models of many-body effects in ordinary metals. Lorentz invariance is shown to play a fundamental role and leads to effects that span the whole spectrum, from the ultraviolet to the infrared. The effect of an emerging Lorentz invariance is also discussed in the context of finite size and edge effects as well as mesoscopic physics. The effects of strong magnetic fields in single layers and some of the main aspects of the many-body problem in graphene bilayers are briefly reviewed. In addition to reviewing the fully understood aspects of the many-body problem in graphene, a plethora of interesting issues are shown to remain open, both theoretically and experimentally, and the field of graphene research is still exciting and vibrant.</p></div>

<div class = "feed-creator">Nianbei Li, Jie Ren, Lei Wang, Gang Zhang, Peter Hänggi, and Baowen Li</div>
<div class = "feed-description"><p>The form of energy termed heat that typically derives from lattice vibrations, i.e., phonons, is usually considered as waste energy and, moreover, deleterious to information processing. However, in this Colloquium, an attempt is made to rebut this common view: By use of tailored models it is demonstrated that phonons can be manipulated similarly to electrons and photons, thus enabling controlled heat transport. Moreover, it is explained that phonons can be put to beneficial use to carry and process information. In the first part ways are presented to control heat transport and to process information for physical systems which are driven by a temperature bias. In particular, a toolkit of familiar electronic analogs for use of phononics is put forward, i.e., phononic devices are described which act as thermal diodes, thermal transistors, thermal logic gates, and thermal memories. These concepts are then put to work to transport, control, and rectify heat in physically realistic nanosystems by devising practical designs of hybrid nanostructures that permit the operation of functional phononic devices; the first experimental realizations are also reported. Next, richer possibilities to manipulate heat flow by use of time-varying thermal bath temperatures or various other external fields are discussed. These give rise to many intriguing phononic nonequilibrium phenomena such as, for example, the directed shuttling of heat, geometrical phase-induced heat pumping, or the phonon Hall effect, which may all find their way into operation with electronic analogs.</p></div>

<div class = "feed-description"><p>Experimental advances with laser intensities above <span>1  TW/cm<sup>2</sup></span>, with pulse durations between roughly 50 and 5 fs, have led to the discovery of new atomic effects that include examples of startlingly high electron correlation. These phenomena have presented an unexpected theoretical challenge as they lie outside the domains of both of the nominally applicable theories, namely, straightforward perturbative radiation theory and quasistatic tunneling theory. The two liberated electrons present a new few-body collective effect. When they are not released independently, one by one, the term nonsequential double ionization has been adopted. Theoretical avenues of attack have emerged in two categories, which are strikingly different. They can be labeled as “all-at-once” and “step-by-step” approaches. Although different, even conceptually opposite in some ways, both approaches have been successful in confronting substantial parts of the experimental data. These approaches are examined and compared with their results in addressing key experimental data obtained over the past decade.</p></div>

<div class = "feed-creator">Göran Grimvall, Blanka Magyari-Köpe, Vidvuds Ozoliņš, and Kristin A. Persson</div>
<div class = "feed-description"><p>Most metallic elements have a crystal structure that is either body-centered cubic (bcc), face-centered close packed, or hexagonal close packed. If the bcc lattice is the thermodynamically most stable structure, the close-packed structures usually are dynamically unstable, i.e., have elastic constants violating the Born stability conditions or, more generally, have phonons with imaginary frequencies. Conversely, the bcc lattice tends to be dynamically unstable if the equilibrium structure is close packed. This striking regularity essentially went unnoticed until <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span> total-energy calculations in the 1990s became accurate enough to model dynamical properties of solids in hypothetical lattice structures. After a review of stability criteria, thermodynamic functions in the vicinity of an instability, Bain paths, and how instabilities may arise or disappear when pressure, temperature, and/or chemical composition is varied are discussed. The role of dynamical instabilities in the ideal strength of solids and in metallurgical phase diagrams is then considered, and comments are made on amorphization, melting, and low-dimensional systems. The review concludes with extensive references to theoretical work on the stability properties of metallic elements.</p></div>

Recent numerical results from several representative models are reviewed, with attention to both their critical and their characteristic properties. Some of the relevant notions and related issues are highlighted, including the origin of power laws often observed in statistical properties of earthquakes, apparently contrasting features of characteristic earthquakes or asperities, the nature of precursory phenomena and nucleation processes, and the origin of slow earthquakes, etc.</p></div>

<div class = "feed-creator">D. J. Rowe, M. J. Carvalho, and J. Repka</div>
<div class = "feed-description"><p>This article reviews many manifestations and applications of dual representations of pairs of groups primarily in atomic and nuclear physics. Examples are given to show how such paired representations are powerful aids in understanding the dynamics associated with shell-model coupling schemes and in identifying the physical situations for which a given scheme is most appropriate. In particular, they suggest model Hamiltonians that are diagonal in the various coupling schemes. The dual pairing of group representations has been applied profitably in mathematics to the study of invariant theory. Parallel applications to the theory of symmetry and dynamical groups in physics are shown to be equally valuable. In particular, the pairing of the representations of a discrete group with those of a continuous Lie group or those of a compact Lie group with those of a noncompact Lie group makes it possible to infer many properties of difficult groups from those of simpler groups. This review starts with the representations of the symmetric and unitary groups, which are used extensively in the many-particle quantum mechanics of bosonic and fermionic systems. It gives a summary of the many solutions and computational techniques for solving problems that arise in applications of symmetry methods in physics and which result from the famous Schur-Weyl duality theorem for the pairing of these representations. It continues to examine many chains of symmetry groups and dual chains of dynamical groups associated with several coupling schemes in atomic and nuclear shell models and the valuable insights and applications that result.</p></div>

<div class = "feed-description"><p>Massive gravity has seen a resurgence of interest due to recent progress which has overcome its traditional problems, yielding an avenue for addressing important open questions such as the cosmological constant naturalness problem. The possibility of a massive graviton has been studied on and off for the past 70 years. During this time, curiosities such as the van Dam, Veltman, and Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity and the Boulware-Deser ghost were uncovered. These results are rederived in a pedagogical manner and the Stückelberg formalism to discuss them from the modern effective field theory viewpoint is developed. Recent progress of the last decade is reviewed, including the dissolution of the vDVZ discontinuity via the Vainshtein screening mechanism, the existence of a consistent effective field theory with a stable hierarchy between the graviton mass and the cutoff, and the existence of particular interactions which raise the maximal effective field theory cutoff and remove the ghosts. In addition, some peculiarities of massive gravitons on curved space, novel theories in three dimensions, and examples of the emergence of a massive graviton from extra dimensions and brane worlds are reviewed.</p></div>

<div class = "feed-description"><p>The science of quantum information has arisen over the last two decades centered on the manipulation of individual quanta of information, known as quantum bits or qubits. Quantum computers, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation are among the most celebrated ideas that have emerged from this new field. It was realized later on that using continuous-variable quantum information carriers, instead of qubits, constitutes an extremely powerful alternative approach to quantum information processing. This review focuses on continuous-variable quantum information processes that rely on any combination of Gaussian states, Gaussian operations, and Gaussian measurements. Interestingly, such a restriction to the Gaussian realm comes with various benefits, since on the theoretical side, simple analytical tools are available and, on the experimental side, optical components effecting Gaussian processes are readily available in the laboratory. Yet, Gaussian quantum information processing opens the way to a wide variety of tasks and applications, including quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and quantum state and channel discrimination. This review reports on the state of the art in this field, ranging from the basic theoretical tools and landmark experimental realizations to the most recent successful developments.</p></div>

<div class = "feed-creator">M. Pfützner, M. Karny, L. V. Grigorenko, and K. Riisager</div>
<div class = "feed-description"><p>The last decades brought impressive progress in synthesizing and studying properties of nuclides located very far from the beta stability line. Among the most fundamental properties of such exotic nuclides, the ones usually established first are the half-life, possible radioactive decay modes, and their relative probabilities. When approaching limits of nuclear stability, new decay modes set in. First, beta decays are accompanied by emission of nucleons from highly excited states of daughter nuclei. Second, when the nucleon separation energy becomes negative, nucleons start being emitted from the ground state. A review of the decay modes occurring close to the limits of stability is presented. The experimental methods used to produce, identify, and detect new species and their radiation are discussed. The current theoretical understanding of these decay processes is reviewed. The theoretical description of the most recently discovered and most complex radioactive process—the two-proton radioactivity—is discussed in more detail.</p></div>

<div class = "feed-description"><p>The homotopy theory of topological defects is a powerful tool for organizing and unifying many ideas across a broad range of physical systems. Recently, experimental progress was made in controlling and measuring colloidal inclusions in liquid crystalline phases. The topological structure of these systems is quite rich but, at the same time, subtle. Motivated by experiment and the power of topological reasoning, the classification of defects in uniaxial nematic liquid crystals was reviewed and expounded upon. Particular attention was paid to the ambiguities that arise in these systems, which have no counterpart in the much-storied <span><span style="font-style: italic;">X</span><span style="font-style: italic;">Y</span></span> model or the Heisenberg ferromagnet.</p></div>

<div class = "feed-description"><p>A comprehensive overview of kaon decays is presented. The standard model predictions are discussed in detail, covering both the underlying short-distance electroweak dynamics and the important interplay of QCD at long distances. Chiral perturbation theory provides a universal framework for treating leptonic, semileptonic, and nonleptonic decays including rare and radiative modes. All allowed decay modes with branching ratios of at least <span>10<sup>-11</sup></span> are analyzed. Some decays with even smaller rates are also included. Decays that are strictly forbidden in the standard model are not considered in this review. The present experimental status and the prospects for future improvements are reviewed.</p></div>

<div class = "feed-creator">Jutta E. Escher, Jason T. Burke, Frank S. Dietrich, Nicholas D. Scielzo, Ian J. Thompson, and Walid Younes</div>
<div class = "feed-description"><p>Nuclear reaction cross sections are important for a variety of applications in the areas of astrophysics, nuclear energy, and national security. When these cross sections cannot be measured directly or predicted reliably, it becomes necessary to develop indirect methods for determining the relevant reaction rates. The <span style="font-style: italic;">surrogate nuclear reactions</span> approach is such an indirect method. First used in the 1970s for estimating <span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>,<span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>)</span> cross sections, the method has recently been recognized as a potentially powerful tool for a wide range of applications that involve compound-nuclear reactions. The method is expected to become an important focus of inverse-kinematics experiments at rare-isotope facilities. The present paper reviews the current status of the surrogate approach. Experimental techniques employed and theoretical descriptions of the reaction mechanisms involved are presented and representative cross section measurements are discussed.</p></div>

<div class = "feed-creator">Walter Metzner, Manfred Salmhofer, Carsten Honerkamp, Volker Meden, and Kurt Schönhammer</div>
<div class = "feed-description"><p>Numerous correlated electron systems exhibit a strongly scale-dependent behavior. Upon lowering the energy scale, collective phenomena, bound states, and new effective degrees of freedom emerge. Typical examples include (i) competing magnetic, charge, and pairing instabilities in two-dimensional electron systems; (ii) the interplay of electronic excitations and order parameter fluctuations near thermal and quantum phase transitions in metals; and (iii) correlation effects such as Luttinger liquid behavior and the Kondo effect showing up in linear and nonequilibrium transport through quantum wires and quantum dots. The functional renormalization group is a flexible and unbiased tool for dealing with such scale-dependent behavior. Its starting point is an exact functional flow equation, which yields the gradual evolution from a microscopic model action to the final effective action as a function of a continuously decreasing energy scale. Expanding in powers of the fields one obtains an exact hierarchy of flow equations for vertex functions. Truncations of this hierarchy have led to powerful new approximation schemes. This review is a comprehensive introduction to the functional renormalization group method for interacting Fermi systems. A self-contained derivation of the exact flow equations is presented and frequently used truncation schemes are described. Reviewing selected applications it is shown how approximations based on the functional renormalization group can be fruitfully used to improve our understanding of correlated fermion systems.</p></div>

First, it is a moderately correlated material that exhibits several novel physical properties; second, it permits the epitaxial growth of essentially single-crystal films; and third, because it is a good conductor, it has attracted interest as a conducting layer in epitaxial heterostructures with a variety of functional oxides. In this review, the present state of knowledge of <span>SrRuO<sub>3</sub></span> thin films is summarized. Their role as a model system for studying magnetism and electron transport characterized by intermediate electron correlation and large magnetocrystalline anisotropy is demonstrated.
