<h3>Course Overview</h3>

The purpose of this course is to provide some exposure to the C++
programming language.  Topics we will cover are listed in the schedule.
We will focus on proper use of C++ language
constructs and idioms.

<p><b>Quizzes</b> - We will have daily quizzes at the <i>beginning</i> of class (really).  No quiz will be given the first or last day of class, making a total of 13 quizzes.  The bottom 3 quiz scores will be dropped.  The quizzes will be on the daily reading assignment.  This doesn't mean that you must have a perfect understanding of everything you read.  It just means that you need to have a grasp of what is being talked about, why it is important, etc.  Quizzes cannot be made up.

<p>Quizzes are given using the i&gt;clicker, which allows you to electronically respond to the quiz questions. The clickers will also be used for in-class participation. You will need to get an i&gt;clicker from the CO-OP or elsewhere by the second class day. You're welcome to buy a used i&gt;clicker or even borrow one from a friend.  You will register your clicker remote in class on the second class day.  You are responsible for bringing your clicker remote to class every day.

<p><b>Assignments</b> - There will be one programming assignment per week, for a total of six.  These assignments make up the majority (60%) of the grade.  Correctness is only the first step in assignment evaluation.  Just as important are clarity, brevity, style and comments.  Always check your code against the <a href="coding_guidelines.html">coding guidelines</a> before submitting.

<p>Assignments are due on Mondays at 8:00am.  <i>No late assignments will be accepted.</i>  I strongly recommend getting the assignment done the Friday before it is due since I check e-mail very little on Saturdays and I don't check it at all on Sundays.  Assignments are graded and returned on Wednesdays.

<p>Assignments must compile and run on the CS UNIX machines.  It is strongly advised that students do all of their program development on a Unix machine.  <a href="https://udb.cs.utexas.edu/amut/acut/">Sign up</a> for a CS Unix account if you don't have one already.  <b>Do this early</b> because it often takes a couple of days to process and you won't be able to turn in any assignments until this account is active.  Programming assignments will be turned in with the <b>Unix-based</b> <a href="turnin.html">turnin</a>.  The web-based turnin <b>will not work</b>.  See the Resources section below for help if you're not familiar with Unix or turnin.

<!-- <p>Due to the numerous issues regarding incompatibility between compilers, operating systems, file formats, etc., on different computer systems, students are strongly advised to do all of their program development on a Unix machine. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that their projects both compile and run on the standard CS Unix machines where they will be graded. <a href="https://udb.cs.utexas.edu/amut/acut/">Sign up</a> for a CS Unix account if you don't have one already.  <b>Do this early</b> because it often takes a couple of days to process and you won't be able to turn in any assignments until this account is active.

<p><b>Final</b> - A final will be given the last day of class and will be worth 20% of the final grade.

<p><b>Blackboard</b> - Scores will be maintained on <a href="https://courses.utexas.edu/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp">Blackboard</a>.

<h3>Late Work Policy</h3>

Again, late assignments are not accepted.  Daily quizzes cannot be made up.


<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>
You are encouraged to discuss assignments with classmates, but you may not share, debug or look at someone else's code.
