<h2>Course Description</h2>
CS108 is designed to help students bootstrap themselves into productive users and developers in the Unix environment as quickly and painlessly as possible. The topics covered are: basic Linux system architecture, tools for users, tools for program development, tools for document development, and scripting. This coverage will include various add-ons commonly associated with Linux, such as the X windowing system, GNU software, and LaTeX. Due to the very large amount of relevant material, students will need to be <b>self-motivated</b>: the emphasis will be on discovery through reading and experimentation.
<br><br>
This is <i>not</i> an operating systems class nor a Linux internals class; it is a practical class that will put students on the road to becoming productive users in a Unix environment. No prior knowledge of Unix/Linux is assumed, though some basic level of computer literacy and computer programming will be necessary.

<h2>Course Materials</h2>
<b>Main textbook (optional):</b> <i>Linux: The Textbook</i>, by Sarwar, Koretsky, and Sarwar. (Available at the University Co-op.) <br>
<b>Optional textbook:</b> <i>Guide to LaTeX: Document Preparation for
Beginners and Advanced Users</i>, by Kopka and Daly. (Available at the
University Co-op.)<br>
<b>The Internet:</b> Feel free to use Google to better
understand course material.
<br> <br>
An old version of the main textbook is available for 2-hour check-out on reserve at PCL:
<i>Unix : the textbook</i> by Syed Mansoor Sarwar, Robert Koretsky,
Syed Aqeel Sarwar. Call number QA 76.76 O63 S3555 2001.
The two texts mentioned above are optional. You will be able to find
information on all of the course material online. However, sometimes
finding information online can be time-consuming. Therefore, the book
can be referenced as a more direct resource.

<h2>Assignments and Grading</h2>
CS108 is offered on a Pass/Fail basis only. For undergraduates, the University defines a passing grade as being equivalent to a D (60%) or higher, so that standard will be used for this course. Students need at least 60% credit in order to pass the course. Credit is calculated based on the following:
<ul>
<li> Ten homework assignments, each worth 8% of the final grade (80% total). </li>
<li> Attendance, worth 20% of the final grade (see below).
</ul>
You are responsible for ensuring that you accumulate the correct
number of points to pass the class. The homeworks in eGradebook will
be graded out of 100.

<h3>Assignment Logistics</h3>
<ul>
<li> You should complete every assignment individually, i.e. <b>no work
in pairs</b>, etc. Please read the note on Academic Integrity below. </li>
<li> Assignments will be submitted electronically, using the UTCS UNIX <i>turnin</i> program, and grades will be returned via <a href="https://courses.utexas.edu/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp">Blackboard</a>. Further details will be announced at the time the first homework assignment is released. </li>
<li>All students will need a UTCS UNIX account. If you do not have an existing account, you should request one as soon as possible at: <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/computing/">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/computing/</a>.</li>
<li>If detailed assignment feedback is desired, please visit the instructor during office hours. Please take advantage of office hours to maximize your learning experience in this course.</li>
<li>To be considered, assignment grading issues should be brought to
the attention of the instructor not later than a week after the grades
for the assignment are made available.</li>
<li>All grading will be done on a UTCS Linux machine. You are
responsible for ensuring your code works on these machines.</li>
<li>A list of public UTCS Linux machines can be found here: <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/accommodations/public_labs/">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/accommodations/public_labs</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Grading of Assignments</h3>
Assignments are graded on a coarse grading scale. Each assignment will receive a score of:
<ul>
  <li> 100 points - If the work is perfect or nearly perfect. </li>
  <li> 80 points - If the work is correct with just a few minor errors. </li>
  <li> 60 points - If less than half of the work contains major errors or is incomplete. </li>
  <li> 40 points - If more than half of the work contains major errors or is incomplete. </li>
  <li> 20 points - If the work is next to useless or grossly incomplete. </li>
  <li> 0 points - If the assignment is turned in late (see below) or not at all. </li>
</ul>
  
<h3>Policy on Late Assignments</h3>
Each student may submit two homework assignments up to 48 hours late without penalty. Assignments submitted after that extended deadline, or submitted late after having exhausted the two allowed late submissions, will receive a grade of 0.

<h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
Each student is allowed at most three unexcused absences. After the
third absence, 10% of the will be deducted from the attendance grade
for each additional absence. I will take attendance by providing a
short, ungraded quiz/survey at the beginning of every class.

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
Please read the <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ear/CodeOfConduct.html">UTCS Code
of Conduct</a>. You are encouraged to discuss the class material with
the other students in the class; however, every assignment you submit
under your name should be your own work. Cheating will be penalized,
as outlined in the <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ear/CodeOfConduct.html">UTCS Code
of Conduct</a>, under "Academic Honesty." <b> This means that any
cheating will result in an automatic failure of the course and must be
reported to Dean of Students office-- use this as your warning! </b>
Remember that working in pairs is not allowed and is considered
cheating. If you find code online, you must reference its use.

<h2>Feedback from Students</h2>
I welcome student comments and requests related to the course content and format. Please feel free to send me e-mail or stop by during office hours to discuss these. Additionally, in mid-semester I will request feedback from students using anonymous surveys.

<h2>Special Circumstances</h2>
For <b>documented excusable absences</b> (as defined by the University), you may be entitled to an extension on a homework deadline. Bring appropriate documentation to the instructor during office hours if such circumstances arise. <br><br>
The University of Texas at Austin provides appropriate academic accommodations for qualified <b>students with disabilities</b> upon request. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, or 471-4641 TTY. If this applies to you, you should do this as soon as possible, to avoid delays in arranging accommodations. <br><br>
If you have a <b>religious holy day</b> that would prevent you from meeting a deadline, you will be allowed to complete the assignment within reasonable time after the holy day, provided that you notify the instructor in advance. The policy of the University of Texas at Austin is that the student must notify the instructor at least fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled on dates he or she will be absent to observe a religious holy day. For religious holy days that fall within the first two weeks of the semester, the notice should be given on the first day of the semester.
