<p align="left"><b>Programming Assignments: </b>Individual assignments are to be 
completed by you alone. You may not share code with other students or other 
programmers. Review the class policy on improper collaboration from the class <a href="../syllabus.htm">

syllabus</a> and how this applies to individual assignments. </p>







    <p>About half the assignments may be done in pairs using a technique called
    <a href="../handouts/papers/Pair-Prog-CACM-1999.pdf">pair programming (Read 
    the paper on pair programming to understand how the technique works.)</a>. 
    Turn in one solution&nbsp; for the pair. (Submit the assignment to one 
    partners turnin account.) Once you start working with a 
    partner on an assignment you may not switch partners. If you do not wish to 
    work with a partner after starting on an assignment you must both complete 
    it individually. You must inform your TA(s) via email if you start working 
    on an assignment with another person and decide to finish as individuals. 
    You may not re-pair after starting the assignment with someone else. When 
    working on pair programming assignments you are expected to spend at least 
    80% of your time on the assignment working with your partner, together at 
    one computer, taking terms typing, and navigating. </p>
    <p>Programs will be written in Java, using the Java 2 Platform Standard 
    Edition 6.0. See the <a href="../software.htm">software page</a> for 
    information on downloading and installing Java at home.</p>
    <p>There are 11 programming assignments.</p>







<p>Assignments are due by 11pm on the due date.</p>







<p>You will have 6 free late (slip) days in 1 day units (1 second&nbsp; to 24 hours = 
1 day) for the semester. </p>







    <ul>
      <li>You may divide your slip days across the assignments in any way you 
      wish to extend deadlines for the assignments except you may not use more 
      than 4 slip days&nbsp;on a single assignment for assignments 1 - 8. No 
      slip days may be used on the last assignment, number 9.</li>
      <li>On pair programming assignments (See above for more information), both 
      members of a pair use their own slip days, and both must have the 
      required number of slip days. </li>
      <li>You may not use slip days to turn an assignment back in for a 
      re-grade.</li>
      <li>Weekends and vacation days do not stop the slip day clock. For example 
      if an assignment is due on Thursday and you turn it in on Monday you have 
      used 4 slip days (Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.)</li>
      <li>To help the TA track your slip-day status you will complete the slip 
      day portion of the appropriate comment in your source code file you turn 
      in.</li>
    </ul>







<p>Unless prohibited, you <u><b>may</b></u> use any component of the language or 
standard library (<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html">The 
Java API</a>). </p>







<p><b>Assignments must compile and run with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">
Eclipse</a> in the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/public-labs">Painter Microlab</a>.</b></p>







<p><a name="AssignmentFormats"></a>Assignments will either be submitted as a 
single Java file or&nbsp; in the form of a single <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/jar/basics/">
JAR</a> (<b>J</b>ava<b> Ar</b>chive)<b> </b>file. Each assignment will specify 

<u><b>exactly</b></u> what to turn in. Assignments that are not in the correct 
format or not named correctly will be penalized as described below.</p>







<p>Assignments must be turned in via the Microlab <a href="../turnin.html">

turnin program</a>. If you are registered for more than one computer science 
class you must ensure that your turn your assignment in to the correct, CS307 
directory. You must turn in a file with the correct name and in the proper 
format. (the source code if I ask for the .java file or the source code files 
packaged as a jar file. The format will be specified on the assignment page.) </p>







<p>If you do not follow the instructions and specifications for assignments 
(name, where to turn in, jar file format) you cause extra work for the graders 
and myself. As a student and potential software developer you must follow 
instructions and specifications. When you are penalized for failure to follow 
instructions it causes you to become a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_case">special case</a>. With over 
150 students the TAs and undergrad proctors use scripts to streamline some 
aspects of grading. Not following the assignment instructions and specifications 
causes these scripts to fail and the graders must spend more time on your 
submission. The following penalties are in place  because there must be consequences for failure to follow 
instructions. Otherwise there is no deterrent.
<a href="../handouts/followingInstructions.htm">Please read this account of a 
student who has seen the issue from both sides</a>.</p>







<p>Penalties for failure to follow instructions and specifications on 
assignments: </p>







    <ul>
      <li>If a file is turned into the wrong account you must contact the 
      instructor with the details. This will cost you 2 slip days. If you do not 
      have 2 slip days the assignment grade is a 0.</li>
      <li>If a file is turned in with the wrong file name you must inform your TA. 
      This will cost you 1 slip day. If you do not have 1 slip day the 
      assignment grade is 0.</li>
      <li>If turning in a jar file you <u><b>must</b></u> turn in the source 
      code. (The .java files, not the .class files.) If you only turn in the 
      .class files your assignment grade will be 0. Classes must be in the 
      default package (no package statement) unless otherwise specified.</li>
      <li>An assignment that does not compile or does not run, loses all 
      correctness points.</li>
    </ul>







<p>Assignments grades are <b>not</b> scaled to effort or time spent working on them. (You may 
spend a large amount of time working on an assignment and still lose many points 
because your program is not correct.) The programs are 
not graded on a strictly linear scale. Points will be deducted for failed test 
cases, poor style, poor efficiency, lack of necessary comments, convoluted 
algorithms, lack of student provided test cases, lack of answers to questions 
regarding the assignment, and other reasons deemed appropriate by the 
instructor. </p>







<p>Each assignment will specify whether it must be done individually or as a 
pair.</p>







<p>Assignments will be checked for plagiarism and copying using

<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~aiken/moss.html">Moss</a>. You may discuss 
high level design issues with your fellow students, but sharing algorithms or 
code or obtaining solutions from another source constitutes academic dishonesty 
and will result in an F for the course. <a href="../syllabus.htm#Collaboration">
Review the class policy on cheating.</a></p>







    <p>The teaching staff will grade, comment, return, and post the grade for an 
    assignment within 5 days. A grade can only be disputed within the following 
    week. (This isn't a weekend bazaar. If there is an error in your grade you 
    have one week to contact your grader. We won't go back at the end of 
    the term to look at an assignment from early in the term.) You are responsible for contacting your 
    TA or proctor if you assignment is not graded in a timely and accurate 
    fashion.</p>

    <p>All grade disputes must be made in writing by email to the TA with 
    supporting evidence or arguments, and will result in the entire assignment 
    being re-graded. <u><b>Remember, no whining. </b></u><hr>
<p><b>Testing: </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Testing your solutions is an important part of programming. </li>
      <li>I will provide some tests with each assignment, some of which may be 
      in error. </li>
      <li>You will create additional test cases for it. Programs will be graded 
      using additional test cases created by the teaching staff. </li>
      <li>I encourage you to use the Piazzza discussion group to address which tests of 
      mine are incorrect and to share tests you write.</li>
      <li>There is a useful tool for posting code to retain formatting and 
      syntax highlighting. It is called pastebin and the URL is
      <a href="http://pastebin.com/">http://pastebin.com/</a>. Feel free to post 
      your tests to that web page and provide the link via Piazzza. 
      There is  pastebin for CS307: <a href="http://cs307.pastebin.com/">http://cs307.pastebin.com/</a> </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Assignments will be checked for correctness with more tests generated by the 
    instructional&nbsp; staff. Your assignment may pass all the provided tests 
    and still be incorrect. Grading test cases will not  be made available. If 
    you would like to see the test specific test cases your code failed on you 
    must meet with your TA during their office hours to see the test cases.<hr>
<p><b>Design and style: </b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Use assertions or if statements that throw exceptions to check for preconditions and post conditions on all public methods.</li>
  <li>Make instance variables within classes <font face="Courier New">private.</font></li>
  <li>Do not use <font face="Courier New">static</font> data as a form of 

    global variables.</li>
  <li>Break up long methods (over 25 lines of code) into smaller methods.</li>
  <li>Use consistent tabbing to make you code easier to understand and follow.</li>
  <li>Use a consistent brace style to make your code easier to understand and 
  follow.</li>
  <li>Include white space to make your code easier to understand and follow</li>
  <li>Comment your code as necessary. (Complicated algorithms or sections of 
  code should be commented. Comments should summarize what is going on, not 
  restate the obvious.)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><b>Documentation: </b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Use /* ... */ or // style comments for implementation details. Explain 

    your implementation so someone not familiar with your solution can understand 

    it.</li>
  <li>Follow
  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html">Sun's 

    Coding Conventions</a>.</li>
  <li>Use good variable names. </li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <p><b>Efficiency: </b>Worry about this last, but your program should run as 
  fast as possible and use as little memory as possible within the constraints 
  of the assignment.</p>
