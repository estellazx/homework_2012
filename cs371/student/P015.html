			<h1>Class Sentiments</h1>
			<h2>Most Rewarding</h2>
			<p>Computer Architecture is the most rewarding class I have taken at UT. I learned a lot and put forth a lot of effort, but I feel I learned more in CS 352 than in any other class.</p>

			<h2>Most Challenging</h2>
			<p>It's difficult to decide the most challenging course because it can easily be confused with the hardest course. Sometimes a course is only hard because it's not taught right, even though the material itself is not challenging. I would have to say CS 372: Operating Systems was my most challenging course, considering all those long nights spent in the computer lab before impending project deadlines.</p>

			<h2>Least Challenging</h2>
			<p>Once again, not to be confused with "easiest". My least challenging course at UT was CS 337: Theory in Programming Practice. A lot of the material had already been covered in prerequisite courses, and I was able to learn the new concepts effortlessly by studying the lecture slides for a short time. On top of that, the programming projects were fairly trivial.</p>

			<h2>Favorite</h2>
			<p>My favorite computer science course at UT has been CS 341: Automata Theory. Also one of the most difficult courses I've taken, the theoretical concepts interest me greatly, and I feel it will be one of my most valuable courses in the long term.</p>

			<h2>Least Favorite</h2>
			<p>By far, my least favorite computer science course at UT has been CS 347: Data Management. Not only was the material presented very poorly, the work was dull and tedious. While the homework and projects weren't hard, it took a great deal of motivation to get them completed.</p>

			<h2>Top Five</h2>
			<p>Superlatives out of the way, my top 5 courses in the Computer Science curriculum at UT have been the following.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>CS 341: <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ear/cs341/">Automata Theory</a></li>
				<li>CS 352: <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mckinley/352/">Computer Systems Architecture</a></li>
				<li>CS 307: <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs307/">Foundations of Computer Science</a></li>
				<li>CS 349: <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ear/cs349/">Contemporary Issues in Computer Science - W</a></li>
				<li>CS 336: <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~cline/336.html">Analysis of Programs</a></li>
			</ol>
