			 	Heyo! My name is Atticus Crowe and I am currently a senior at the University of Texas at Austin. I was originally a 
				Chemical Engineer my freshman year, but I wizened up and switched over to Computer Science at the end of my first year.
				<br /><br />
				Once I am done with my college career, I'll be moving onto Microsoft as part of the Online Services Division, up at 
				Bellevue, WA. 
				<br /><br />
				Besides being a computer science major, I am also the President of the Engineering Chamber Orchestra, 
				a student organization devoted to bringing students and faculty together in small ensembles that will then practice
				at the end of the semester! For more information about EChO, please search for us!

				Here you may find my favorite 5 classes within the Computer Science degree. Although some of them may not exist,
				I still enjoyed them more than others, so I have decided to include them here (look for their equivalent if you're interested
				in taking them!) Enjoy:
