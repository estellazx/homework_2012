<H3>Course Description:</H3> Information Assurance is dedicated to
keeping information safe from harm.  This encompasses computer
security, but also communications security, operations security, and
physical security. That's a lot to study in one course.  For example,
NSA has an Information Assurance Directorate tasked with: 
"detecting, reporting, and responding to cyber threats; making
encryption codes to securely pass information between systems; and
embedding IA measures directly into the emerging Global Information
Grid. It includes building secure audio and video communications
equipment, making tamper protection products, and providing trusted
microelectronics solutions. It entails testing the security of
customers' systems, providing OPSEC assistance, and evaluating
commercial software and hardware against nationally set standards, to
better meet our nation's IA needs."<P>

Our approach will be to cover selected topics from this very broad
area of study with the goal of preparing the student to think
critically about security from a wholistic perspective, rather than a
purely technical perspective.  Topics may include:
<OL TYPE="1" START="1">
<LI>Introduction to Information Assurance
<LI>Metrics for Information Assurance
<LI>Networking and Cryptography
<LI>Information Assurance Planning and Deployment
<LI>Vulnerabilities and Protection
<LI>Identity and Trust Technologies
<LI>Verification and Evaluation
<LI>Incident Response
<LI>Human Factors
<LI>Legal, Ethical, and Social Implications 
</OL>

My intention is that the class will be conducted more like a graduate
seminar than like a traditional lecture class.  That means that
<I>students are expected to read assigned materials prior to the class
meeting and to participate actively in the discussion.</i> A
significant portion of your grade will be based on your engagement in
the class.<P>

Notice that CS students at UT have the option of completing a number
of security-related courses and receiving a government-sanctioned certification in
security.  See the following link for information: 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate-program/cs-degrees/infosec-certificate">
Security certification.</A>


<P>

<H3>Prerequisites:</H3> You are expected to have taken and passed the
following courses (or equivalent) with a grade of at least C: CS310 or
CS310H, CS336 or CS336H, and M408D or M408M.  If you don't have the
prerequisites, be sure to clear it with the CS department, or risk
being dropped from the course.<P>

<H3>Using Piazza:</H3> This semester we will be using Piazza for class
discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and
efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. Rather than emailing
questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your
questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the
developers, email team@piazza.com.  Our class page will be set up
shortly and announced here.


<H3>Textbook and Slides:</H3> 

There is no required text for the class this semester.<P>

Handouts of all class slides will be made available over the course of
the semester via links below.  Slides are available in PostScript (PS)
or in PDF format.  The PostScript files can be viewed with Ghostview
or printed on any postscript-compatible printer.  The PDF files can be
viewed with Acroread. <P>

<B>Acknowledgement: </B> The slides for this course originally began
from a slideset developed by Mark Wahl when he taught this course in
the Fall Semester, 2005 and used with his permission.  His version
included the following notice: <I>Copyright 2005.  This material is

<H3>Readings and Assignments:</H3> I will occasionally assign readings
from papers over the course of the semester.  You are expected to have
read the assigned material and also to have read the course slides
before class.  There may be pop quizzes on this material at any
time.<P>

There will be several projects assigned over the course of the
semester.  Each student should work on assignments individually unless
I explicitly say that teams are allowed.  The projects generally will
not be programming projects, but will involve writing short reports on
various aspects of security.  This is not a writing course and your
spelling and grammar skill will not be graded.  Rather, the grade will
depend on the amount of thought and (possibly) research you put into
the assignment. However, you should strive to produce quality work
that is grammatically correct and formatted nicely.<P>

It is likely that several of the assignments will be related to a
given topic.  This semester, that topic will
be <i>CyberWarfare</i>.<P>

<b>Standing assignment:</b> Read over the class slides before we
discuss them.<P> 

<!-- 

<b>Reading assignment:</b> Read <A

<A HREF="assignment-poster.html">Assignment 4: Several parts, due at various

-->

In addition to the other assignments, each student will become the
class expert in some specialized security topic, write a paper on that
topic, and design a poster on the topic for a poster session and
present the topic in class.  A partial list of possible topics will be
offered.  If a topic strikes your fancy, you can claim it by sending
me an email.  All topics must be distinct.   Since there are quite a
few students in this class, we may do this in pairs. 

<H3>Quizzes:</H3> Short in-class quizzes may be given at any time.
These will cover material covered in previous classes and check
whether you are keeping up with the reading. <I>There
will be no makeups for quizzes you miss,</I> but any single quiz is
only a tiny proportion of your final grade.<P>

<H3>Tests:</H3> There will be two major tests during the semester.
Your best study strategy is to review the readings and class notes and
ensure that you understand thoroughly the topics we covered in class.
Tests are open book / open notes.  Both tests will be given during the
regular class-time.  The <b>midterm</b> will be held very near the
middle of the semester, in class and will cover those topics we have
covered in class up to that point. A sample midterm will be posted.

<!-- here: <A HREF="sample-midterm2.pdf">sample midterm</A>.  Don't worry
about the specific questions on the sample, but understand that the
form will be very similar.   -->

The <B>final test</B> will be held in class the last week of
classes. A sample final test will be posted.  There will be no final
exam.<P>

<H3>No laptops:</H3> Students are asked not to have their laptops or
other electronic devices open during class.  Copies of all slides will
be provided.  Please just listen and absorb the material. <P>

<H3>Grading policies:</H3> Class attendance is required and will be
checked on a majority of class days.  Excessive unexcused absences
will result in a reduced grade.  <I>If you don't plan to come to class
regularly, don't register for this class.</I> Signing in for another
student not present will be considered cheating by both students.<P>

Grades are averaged using the weighting below, with the following
proviso: <I>You will not receive passing credit for the course if you
have unexcused absences for more than half of the scheduled class
meetings at which attendance is taken.</I><P>

Also, this class largely consists of discussion.  You <i>must</i>
participate in the discussions.  If you are either too shy or too lazy
to participate, it will affect your grade negatively.  Please discuss
it with me if you have issues that keep you from speaking up in
class. <BR><BR>

Course grades are assigned on the scale: A = 90-100; B = 80-90; etc.,
except that I reserve the right to be more generous than this
indicates.  That is, I may enlarge any of these ranges;  I will not
shrink any range.<P>

<H3>How to Succeed in this Class:</H3> 

You succeed in this class by participating fully.  It may be possible
to coast through it, but you won't get a good grade.  

<OL TYPE="1" START="1">
<LI>Come to class regularly
<LI>Read the slides several times before class
<LI>Think carefully about the questions embedded in the slides
(usually in purple)
<LI>Do any assigned readings on time
<LI>Participate in the class discussions

<H3>Class Newsgroup:</H3> Your TA will set up a discussion group on
Blackboard: <A
HREF="https://courses.utexas.edu/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp">Blackboard</A>.
Login with your UTEID and password. You will see announcements and
courses in which you are enrolled. For each course, there are links to
bmany useful resources.  Your TA will post important announcements and
assignments, and maintain a discussion forum called "Information
Assurance and Security" in which you can discuss the course in
general. <P>

<H3>Scholastic Dishonesty:</H3> Academic dishonesty will not be
tolerated.  See 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/academics/conduct">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/academics/conduct</A>

for an excellent summary of expectations of a student in a CS
class.<P>

All work must be the student's own effort (with the exception of
explicitly approved group effort on projects).  No deviation from the
standards of scholastic honesty or professional integrity will be
tolerated.  Scholastic dishonesty is a serious violation of UT policy;
and will likely result in an automatic F in the course and may result
in further penalties imposed by the department or by the university.
Don't do it.  If you are caught, you will regret it.  And if you're
not caught, you're still a cheater.<P>
